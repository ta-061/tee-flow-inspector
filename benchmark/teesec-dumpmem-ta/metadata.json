  "display_name": "teesec-research: Dump Memory TA - Full TEE Memory Extraction to REE",
  "description": "OP-TEE Trusted Application that accepts arbitrary memory address and length from REE (CWE-20 weak input validation) and dumps the contents of any TEE memory region back to the REE via IMSG() logging (CWE-200 unencrypted output). This TA demonstrates the worst-case bad partitioning scenario: REE controls what TEE memory is read and where the result goes, with only a TEE_CheckMemoryAccessRights() call as a partial mitigation.",
