<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `&lt;param_types&gt;`, `&lt;params&gt;`

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes four parameters:
1. `session`: A pointer to a session (not tainted).
2. `command`: A command identifier (not tainted).
3. `param_types`: A parameter type identifier (tainted).
4. `params`: An array of `TEE_Param` structures (tainted).

### Control Flow Analysis
The function uses a switch statement to determine which command to execute based on the `command` parameter. The commands are:
- `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW`
- `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW`
- `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE`
- Default case for unsupported commands

### Taint Propagation Analysis
1. **Command Handling**:
   - The `command` parameter is not tainted, but it controls which case is executed. This introduces an implicit flow where the execution path depends on the value of `command`.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW`**:
     - Calls `create_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
     - Both `param_types` and `params` are tainted, so they propagate their taint to the `create_raw_object` function.
   - **Case `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW`**:
     - Calls `read_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
     - Again, both `param_types` and `params` are tainted, propagating taint to `read_raw_object`.
   - **Case `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE`**:
     - Calls `delete_object(param_types, params)`.
     - Both `param_types` and `params` are tainted, propagating taint to `delete_object`.
   - **Default Case**:
     - Logs an error message but does not propagate taint since it does not call any function that uses the tainted parameters.

### Data Aliases
- The `params` parameter is an array of `TEE_Param` structures. Each element of this array can be considered a potential alias for tainted data, as the contents of the array can be modified by the called functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`).

### Operations Propagating Taint
- The function does not perform any direct assignments or operations that create new variables. However, the calls to `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object` will likely involve operations that utilize the tainted parameters, thus propagating the taint further into those functions.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- **Tainted Inputs**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Control Dependency**: The execution path is determined by the `command` parameter.
- **Taint Propagation**:
  - `param_types` and `params` are passed to the respective functions based on the command.
  - Taint is propagated to `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object`.
- **Data Aliases**: The `params` array contains multiple elements that can be modified, potentially carrying taint through their contents.

### Conclusion
The `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function effectively propagates tainted data through its control flow based on the command provided. The taint from `param_types` and `params` is passed to other functions, which may further manipulate or utilize this tainted data. Care should be taken in those functions to ensure that tainted data is handled securely.</pre>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `delete_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (specifically, `params[0]`)

### Function Overview
The `delete_object` function performs the following key operations:
1. Validates the `param_types`.
2. Allocates memory for an object ID.
3. Copies data from the `params` to the allocated memory.
4. Opens a persistent object using the object ID.
5. Deletes the persistent object if it exists.
6. Frees allocated memory.

### Taint Propagation Analysis

1. **Parameter Validation**:
   - The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected value (`exp_param_types`). If it does not match, the function returns an error (`TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`), and no taint propagation occurs in this case.

2. **Object ID Size**:
   - `obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;`
     - The size of the object ID is taken from the tainted `params[0]`. This means `obj_id_sz` is tainted.

3. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);`
     - The allocation itself does not propagate taint, but it is important to note that `obj_id` will hold tainted data after the next operation.

4. **Copying Tainted Data**:
   - `TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);`
     - This operation copies the contents of `params[0].memref.buffer` (which is tainted) into `obj_id`. Thus, `obj_id` now contains tainted data.

5. **Opening Persistent Object**:
   - `res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(...)`
     - The function uses `obj_id` (which is tainted) to open a persistent object. This means that the call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` is now operating on tainted data. If this function uses `obj_id` in a way that affects security (e.g., accessing or modifying sensitive data), it could be a potential sink for tainted data.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - If `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns the result. The taint does not propagate further in this case, but the error handling does not sanitize or clear the tainted data.

7. **Deleting the Object**:
   - `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(object);`
     - This function is called if the object is successfully opened. If `obj_id` was tainted and the object is deleted based on that tainted identifier, this could be considered a sink for tainted data.

8. **Memory Cleanup**:
   - `TEE_Free(obj_id);`
     - This operation frees the memory allocated for `obj_id`. It does not propagate taint but is important for resource management.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- **Tainted Input**: `params[0]` (specifically, `params[0].memref.buffer`)
- **Taint Propagation**:
  - `obj_id_sz` is tainted from `params[0].memref.size`.
  - `obj_id` becomes tainted after copying data from `params[0].memref.buffer`.
  - The call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` uses tainted data (`obj_id`).
  - The deletion of the object is based on tainted data, making it a potential sink.

### Conclusion
The `delete_object` function effectively propagates tainted data from the `params` input through various operations. The taint reaches a potential sink when the function attempts to open and delete a persistent object based on the tainted `obj_id`. Care should be taken to ensure that the data being used to open and delete objects is validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_MemMove</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To continue the taint analysis, we will focus on the `TEE_MemMove` function, which is called within the `delete_object` function. We will analyze how tainted data could affect the parameters `arg0` and `arg2` (indices [0, 2]) and track the flow of tainted data through this external function.

### Tainted Data Context
- **Tainted Input**: `params[0]` (specifically, `params[0].memref.buffer`)
- **Tainted Data Propagation**: 
  - `obj_id` is tainted after copying data from `params[0].memref.buffer` using `TEE_MemMove`.

### Function Overview
The `TEE_MemMove` function is typically used to copy a block of memory from one location to another. The exact implementation is not provided, but we can infer its behavior based on standard memory manipulation functions.

### Taint Propagation Analysis for `TEE_MemMove`

1. **Parameters of `TEE_MemMove`**:
   - **Source**: `params[0].memref.buffer` (tainted)
   - **Destination**: `obj_id` (initially untainted, but becomes tainted after the operation)
   - **Size**: `obj_id_sz` (tainted, derived from `params[0].memref.size`)

2. **Data Aliasing**:
   - The `obj_id` variable is a pointer that will hold the copied data from the tainted source. If `params[0].memref.buffer` points to sensitive data, then `obj_id` will also point to that sensitive data after the copy operation.
   - If `params[0].memref.buffer` is modified or accessed later in the code, it could lead to further taint propagation or unintended data exposure.

3. **Tainted Data Operations**:
   - The operation `TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);` directly propagates taint from the source buffer to the destination pointer. After this operation, `obj_id` contains the same data as `params[0].memref.buffer`, which is tainted.
   - If `TEE_MemMove` does not perform any checks on the source or destination pointers, it could lead to vulnerabilities, especially if the source buffer contains sensitive information.

### Tracking Tainted Data to Parameters `arg0` and `arg2`
- **Parameter `arg0`**: 
  - If `arg0` is intended to be the destination for the data being copied (e.g., `obj_id`), then it will be tainted after the `TEE_MemMove` operation. This means that any subsequent operations that use `arg0` will also be operating on tainted data.
  
- **Parameter `arg2`**: 
  - If `arg2` is used in conjunction with the data being manipulated (e.g., as a size or flag), it could also be affected by the tainted data. For instance, if `arg2` is used to determine how much data to read or write based on the contents of `obj_id`, it could lead to unintended consequences if `obj_id` contains malicious or unexpected data.

### Potential Sinks
- If `arg0` or `arg2` are used in subsequent function calls that perform operations based on their values, they could act as sinks for tainted data. For example:
  - If `arg0` is passed to another function that performs sensitive operations (like accessing secure storage or modifying critical data), it could lead to security vulnerabilities.
  - If `arg2` is used to control the flow of data (e.g., as a size parameter), it could lead to buffer overflows or other memory-related vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion
The `TEE_MemMove` function plays a critical role in propagating tainted data from `params[0].memref.buffer` to `obj_id`. This tainted data can subsequently affect parameters `arg0` and `arg2`, especially if they are used in sensitive operations. It is essential to ensure that any data copied into `obj_id` is validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities in the subsequent use of these parameters. Proper checks should be implemented to ensure that the data being manipulated does not lead to unintended consequences or security breaches.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Function Signature**: 
  ```c
  TEE_Result TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint(void __unused *session,
                                        uint32_t command,
                                        uint32_t param_types,
                                        TEE_Param params[4])
  ```

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as parameters. Both are considered tainted upon entry.

2. **Switch Statement**:
   - The function uses a switch statement to determine which command to execute based on the `command` parameter. The `command` parameter is not tainted, but it controls the flow of execution.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - Each case in the switch statement calls a different function, passing the tainted parameters `param_types` and `params`.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW`**:
     ```c
     return create_raw_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - Tainted data (`param_types`, `params`) is passed to `create_raw_object`. The taint propagates to this function.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW`**:
     ```c
     return read_raw_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - Tainted data is passed to `read_raw_object`. The taint propagates to this function.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE`**:
     ```c
     return delete_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - Tainted data is passed to `delete_object`. The taint propagates to this function.

   - **Default Case**:
     ```c
     EMSG(&quot;Command ID 0x%x is not supported&quot;, command);
     return TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED;
     ```
     - In the default case, no tainted data is used, and the function simply logs an error message. There is no propagation of taint here.

### Data Aliases
- The `params` parameter is an array of `TEE_Param` structures. Each element of this array can be considered a potential alias for the tainted data, as the contents of `params` can be modified by the functions it is passed to.
- If any of the functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`) modify the contents of `params`, the taint will persist in those modifications.

### Operations Propagating Taint
- The taint is propagated through the function calls to `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object`. Each of these functions will receive the tainted parameters and may further propagate the taint depending on their implementations.

### Implicit Data Flow
- The control flow of the switch statement is dependent on the value of `command`. If `command` is influenced by user input or external data, it can lead to different paths being executed, which may affect the taint propagation indirectly.
- If the `command` value is derived from tainted data, it could lead to a situation where the execution path taken (and thus the functions called) is influenced by tainted data.

### Summary
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Taint Propagation**: Taint is propagated to `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object`.
- **Data Aliases**: `params` is an array of `TEE_Param`, which can contain multiple tainted values.
- **Control Dependencies**: The execution path is determined by the `command` parameter, which can affect which functions are called and how taint is propagated.

In conclusion, the taint analysis shows that the function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` effectively propagates tainted data through its control flow, and the taint remains present in the called functions unless explicitly sanitized.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: delete_object</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `delete_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (specifically `params[0]`) flows through the function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (specifically `params[0]`)

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as parameters. The `params` array is tainted, specifically `params[0]`, which is expected to contain a memory reference for the object ID.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   ```c
   if (param_types != exp_param_types)
       return TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS;
   ```
   - The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected parameter types. If it does not match, the function returns an error. This check does not affect taint propagation.

3. **Extracting Object ID Size**:
   ```c
   obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;
   ```
   - The size of the object ID is extracted from the tainted `params[0].memref.size`. This means that `obj_id_sz` is now tainted, as it is derived from tainted data.

4. **Memory Allocation**:
   ```c
   obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);
   if (!obj_id)
       return TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
   ```
   - Memory is allocated for `obj_id` based on the tainted size `obj_id_sz`. If the allocation fails, the function returns an error. The `obj_id` pointer itself is not tainted at this point, but it will hold tainted data in the next step.

5. **Copying Tainted Data**:
   ```c
   TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);
   ```
   - The contents of `params[0].memref.buffer` (which is tainted) are copied into `obj_id`. This operation propagates the taint to `obj_id`, meaning that `obj_id` now contains tainted data.

6. **Opening Persistent Object**:
   ```c
   res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(TEE_STORAGE_PRIVATE,
                                  obj_id, obj_id_sz,
                                  TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_READ |
                                  TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_WRITE_META,
                                  &amp;object);
   ```
   - The function attempts to open a persistent object using the tainted `obj_id` and `obj_id_sz`. If the object ID is derived from user input or untrusted sources, this could lead to security vulnerabilities. The result of this operation (`res`) is not tainted, but it indicates whether the operation was successful.

7. **Error Handling**:
   ```c
   if (res != TEE_SUCCESS) {
       EMSG(&quot;Failed to open persistent object, res=0x%08x&quot;, res);
       TEE_Free(obj_id);
       return res;
   }
   ```
   - If the object cannot be opened, an error message is logged, and the function returns. The taint does not propagate further in this case.

8. **Closing and Deleting the Object**:
   ```c
   TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(object);
   ```
   - If the object is successfully opened, it is then closed and deleted. This operation does not introduce new taint but operates on the object that was accessed using tainted data.

9. **Freeing Memory**:
   ```c
   TEE_Free(obj_id);
   ```
   - The allocated memory for `obj_id` is freed. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.

### Taint Propagation Summary
- **Tainted Data**: The taint from `params[0]` propagates to `obj_id` through the `TEE_MemMove` operation.
- **New Taint Propagation**: The size of the object ID (`obj_id_sz`) is also tainted as it is derived from `params[0].memref.size`.
- **Sinks**: The tainted data reaches a sink when it is used in `TEE_OpenPersistentObject`, which could potentially lead to security issues if the object ID is derived from untrusted sources.

### Conclusion
The `delete_object` function effectively propagates tainted data from `params[0]` to `obj_id`, which is then used to open a persistent object. This flow of tainted data to a critical operation (opening a persistent object) represents a potential security risk, especially if the input is not properly validated or sanitized. The function does not introduce new taint after the initial propagation, but it does operate on tainted data, which is crucial for security considerations.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_Malloc</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_Malloc` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `arg0` (which comes from the previous function, specifically `obj_id_sz` derived from `params[0].memref.size`) flows through this function. Since the implementation of `TEE_Malloc` is not provided, we will make some assumptions based on typical memory allocation behavior.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `arg0` (which corresponds to `obj_id_sz` from the previous function)

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function `TEE_Malloc` is called with `arg0` as the size parameter for memory allocation. This size is tainted because it was derived from the tainted `params[0].memref.size`.

2. **Memory Allocation**:
   - The purpose of `TEE_Malloc` is to allocate a block of memory of size `arg0`. The taint from `arg0` propagates into the memory allocation process. If `arg0` is derived from untrusted input, this could lead to various issues, such as:
     - **Memory Corruption**: If the size is manipulated or invalid, it could lead to buffer overflows or underflows.
     - **Denial of Service**: If an attacker can control the size, they might allocate excessive memory, leading to resource exhaustion.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The return value of `TEE_Malloc` is a pointer to the allocated memory. If the allocation is successful, this pointer will point to a block of memory that is now tainted because it was allocated based on the tainted size `arg0`.
   - If the allocation fails (e.g., due to insufficient memory), the function typically returns `NULL`. In this case, the taint does not propagate further since no memory is allocated.

### Taint Propagation Summary
- **Tainted Data**: The taint from `arg0` (the size of the memory to allocate) propagates into the memory allocation process.
- **New Taint Propagation**: The pointer returned by `TEE_Malloc` (let&#x27;s call it `allocated_memory`) is tainted because it is based on the tainted size `arg0`. If the allocation is successful, `allocated_memory` will hold tainted data.
- **Sinks**: The tainted data reaches a sink when the allocated memory is used in subsequent operations (e.g., copying data into it). In the context of the previous function, this would be when `TEE_MemMove` is called to copy data into the allocated memory.

### Conclusion
The `TEE_Malloc` function propagates tainted data from `arg0` (the size of the memory to allocate) to the pointer returned by the function. This pointer is considered tainted because it is derived from potentially untrusted input. The function does not introduce new taint but operates on tainted data, which is critical for security considerations. If the allocated memory is subsequently used without proper validation or sanitization, it could lead to vulnerabilities such as memory corruption or unauthorized access to sensitive data.</pre>

To analyze the <code>TEE_Malloc</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>arg0</code> (which represents the size of the memory to be allocated, derived from the tainted <code>params</code> in the previous function) flows through this function. Since the implementation of <code>TEE_Malloc</code> is not provided, we will make assumptions based on typical memory allocation behavior.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- **Tainted Input**: <code>arg0</code> (the size of memory to allocate, which is derived from <code>params[0].memref.size</code> in the <code>delete_object</code> function)<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Function Entry**:<br>   - The function <code>TEE_Malloc</code> is called with <code>arg0</code> as the size of the memory to allocate. This size is derived from the tainted <code>params[0]</code>, which means <code>arg0</code> is also tainted.<br><br>2. **Memory Allocation**:<br>   - The purpose of <code>TEE_Malloc</code> is to allocate a block of memory of size <code>arg0</code>. The taint analysis here focuses on whether the allocation process itself propagates taint or if it introduces any new variables that could carry taint.<br><br>3. **Return Value**:<br>   - The return value of <code>TEE_Malloc</code> is a pointer to the allocated memory. If the allocation is successful, this pointer can be considered tainted because it is associated with the size that was derived from tainted data.

While the function itself does not perform any operations on the data, the tainted pointer it returns can be used in later operations that may involve sensitive data handling. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that any data written to or read from this allocated memory is properly validated to prevent security issues. Further analysis of how this pointer is used in subsequent functions would be necessary to fully understand the implications of the taint propagation.

CWE-20: Tainted data from `params[0].memref.buffer` reaches `obj_id` in `delete_object()`, which is then used in `TEE_OpenPersistentObject()`. There are no validation steps for the contents of `params[0]`, allowing for potential exploitation.</pre></div>

<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Function Signature**: 
  ```c
  TEE_Result TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint(void __unused *session,
                                        uint32_t command,
                                        uint32_t param_types,
                                        TEE_Param params[4])
  ```

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as inputs. Both are considered tainted from the start.

2. **Switch Statement**:
   - The function uses a switch statement to determine which command to execute based on the `command` parameter. The `command` parameter is not tainted, but it controls the flow of execution.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - Each case in the switch statement calls a different function, passing the tainted parameters `param_types` and `params`.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW`**:
     ```c
     return create_raw_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - Tainted data (`param_types`, `params`) is passed to `create_raw_object`. This function will receive tainted data and may propagate it further.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW`**:
     ```c
     return read_raw_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - Similar to the previous case, tainted data is passed to `read_raw_object`, which may also propagate the taint.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE`**:
     ```c
     return delete_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - Again, tainted data is passed to `delete_object`, which may further propagate the taint.

   - **Default Case**:
     ```c
     EMSG(&quot;Command ID 0x%x is not supported&quot;, command);
     return TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED;
     ```
     - In the default case, no tainted data is propagated since the function does not call any other functions with tainted parameters.

### Data Aliases
- The `params` parameter is an array of `TEE_Param` structures. If any of the elements in this array are modified within the called functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`), those modifications will affect the original `params` array due to pointer semantics in C.
- If any of the functions modify the contents of `params`, the taint will persist in the modified data.

### Operations Propagating Taint
- The taint is propagated through the function calls to `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object`. Each of these functions will receive the tainted parameters and may perform operations that further propagate or utilize the taint.

### Implicit Flow
- The control flow of the switch statement is dependent on the value of `command`. If `command` is influenced by external input, it can lead to different paths of execution, potentially affecting the security of the application based on the tainted data.

### Summary
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Flow**: Tainted data is passed to three different functions based on the command value.
- **Data Aliases**: `params` is an array that can be modified by the called functions.
- **Taint Propagation**: Taint is propagated through function calls.
- **Control Dependencies**: The execution path is determined by the `command` parameter, which can affect how tainted data is handled.

In conclusion, the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function effectively propagates tainted data through its control flow, and the taint can persist in the system if the called functions manipulate the `params` array. Proper validation and sanitization of the input parameters are crucial to ensure the security of the application.</pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: delete_object</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `delete_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (specifically `params[0]`) flows through the function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (specifically `params[0]`)

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as inputs. The `params` array is tainted from the previous function (`TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`).

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   ```c
   if (param_types != exp_param_types)
       return TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS;
   ```
   - The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected parameter types. If it does not match, the function returns an error. This check does not propagate taint but ensures that the function is called with the correct parameters.

3. **Extracting Object ID Size**:
   ```c
   obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;
   ```
   - The size of the object ID is extracted from the first element of the `params` array. Since `params` is tainted, `obj_id_sz` is also considered tainted because it is derived from tainted data.

4. **Memory Allocation**:
   ```c
   obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);
   if (!obj_id)
       return TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
   ```
   - Memory is allocated for `obj_id` based on the tainted size `obj_id_sz`. If the allocation fails, the function returns an error. The allocation itself does not propagate taint, but it creates a new variable (`obj_id`) that will hold potentially tainted data.

5. **Copying Tainted Data**:
   ```c
   TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);
   ```
   - The contents of `params[0].memref.buffer` are copied into `obj_id`. This operation propagates the taint from `params[0]` to `obj_id`. After this line, `obj_id` contains tainted data.

6. **Opening Persistent Object**:
   ```c
   res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(TEE_STORAGE_PRIVATE,
                                  obj_id, obj_id_sz,
                                  TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_READ |
                                  TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_WRITE_META,
                                  &amp;object);
   ```
   - The function attempts to open a persistent object using the tainted `obj_id` and `obj_id_sz`. If the `obj_id` contains malicious or invalid data, it could lead to security issues. The result of this operation (`res`) is also influenced by the tainted data.

7. **Error Handling**:
   ```c
   if (res != TEE_SUCCESS) {
       EMSG(&quot;Failed to open persistent object, res=0x%08x&quot;, res);
       TEE_Free(obj_id);
       return res;
   }
   ```
   - If the object cannot be opened, an error message is logged, and the function returns the error code. The taint does not propagate further in this case, but the error handling does not sanitize or validate the tainted data.

8. **Closing and Deleting the Object**:
   ```c
   TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(object);
   ```
   - This function call does not directly involve tainted data but operates on the `object` handle obtained from the previous step. If the `object` was opened using tainted data, it could lead to unintended consequences.

9. **Freeing Memory**:
   ```c
   TEE_Free(obj_id);
   ```
   - The allocated memory for `obj_id` is freed. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.

10. **Return Statement**:
    ```c
    return res;
    ```
    - The function returns the result of the operation, which may be influenced by tainted data.

### Taint Propagation Summary
- **Tainted Data**: The taint from `params[0]` propagates to `obj_id` through the `TEE_MemMove` operation.
- **New Taint Propagation**: The taint is propagated when `obj_id` is used in the `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` function.
- **Sinks**: The potential sink in this function is the `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` call, which could lead to security vulnerabilities if the `obj_id` is not properly validated. If `obj_id` contains malicious data, it could allow unauthorized access or manipulation of persistent objects.

### Conclusion
The `delete_object` function effectively propagates tainted data from the `params` array to the `obj_id` variable, which is then used in a critical operation that could lead to security vulnerabilities. Proper validation and sanitization of the input parameters are essential to prevent potential attacks.</pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_MemMove</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To continue the taint analysis, we will focus on the `TEE_MemMove` function, which is used in the `delete_object` function to copy potentially tainted data from `params[0].memref.buffer` to `obj_id`. We will analyze how tainted data could affect multiple parameters, specifically `arg0` and `arg2`, and track the flow of tainted data through this operation.

### Tainted Data Flow Analysis for `TEE_MemMove`

1. **Function Signature**:
   - The signature of `TEE_MemMove` is not provided, but we can infer that it likely has the following form:
     ```c
     void TEE_MemMove(void *dest, const void *src, size_t size);
     ```

2. **Tainted Input**:
   - In the context of the `delete_object` function, the tainted input is `params[0].memref.buffer`, which is copied to `obj_id`:
     ```c
     TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);
     ```

3. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `params` array is an array of `TEE_Param` structures, and `params[0].memref.buffer` is a pointer to the memory location that contains the data to be copied. 
   - If `params[0].memref.buffer` points to a location that is aliased by other variables or parameters, any modifications made to this buffer will affect those aliases as well.

4. **Tainted Data Operations**:
   - The operation `TEE_MemMove` copies data from the source (`params[0].memref.buffer`) to the destination (`obj_id`). If the source buffer contains tainted data, the destination will also contain tainted data after the operation.
   - The size of the data being copied is determined by `obj_id_sz`, which is derived from `params[0].memref.size`. If `obj_id_sz` is influenced by tainted data, it could lead to buffer overflows or underflows if not properly validated.

5. **Tracking Tainted Data to Parameters**:
   - **arg0**: If `arg0` is intended to be the first parameter of a subsequent function call that uses `obj_id`, then `arg0` will be tainted because it will receive the tainted data from `obj_id`.
   - **arg2**: If `arg2` is another parameter that is affected by the data in `obj_id` (for example, if it is derived from `obj_id` or used in conjunction with it), then it will also be tainted. This could happen if `arg2` is set based on the contents of `obj_id` or if it is used in a function that processes `obj_id`.

### Potential Sinks
- If `arg0` or `arg2` are used in subsequent function calls that perform sensitive operations (e.g., accessing secure storage, modifying persistent objects, etc.), the tainted data could lead to security vulnerabilities.
- For example, if `arg0` is passed to a function that performs access control checks, and it contains tainted data, it could allow unauthorized access or manipulation of sensitive resources.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- **Tainted Data Source**: `params[0].memref.buffer`
- **Tainted Data Destination**: `obj_id` (after `TEE_MemMove`)
- **Affected Parameters**: 
  - `arg0` will be tainted if it is set based on `obj_id`.
  - `arg2` will be tainted if it is derived from or used in conjunction with `obj_id`.
- **Taint Propagation**: The taint propagates from `params[0]` to `obj_id` and potentially to `arg0` and `arg2` in subsequent operations.

### Conclusion
The `TEE_MemMove` function plays a critical role in propagating tainted data from the `params` array to the `obj_id` variable. This tainted data can further affect other parameters like `arg0` and `arg2`, leading to potential security vulnerabilities if not properly validated. It is essential to ensure that the data being copied is sanitized and that any subsequent use of `arg0` and `arg2` is performed with caution to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of sensitive resources.</pre>

To analyze the <code>delete_object</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>params</code> (from the previous function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>) flows through this function.

To continue the taint analysis based on the previous results, we will focus on how tainted data can affect multiple parameters, specifically <code>arg0</code> and <code>arg2</code>, in the context of the <code>delete_object</code> function. We will also pay attention to data aliases and tainted data operations.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The <code>delete_object</code> function processes the <code>params</code> array, particularly <code>params[0]</code>, which is tainted. The analysis will track how this tainted data can affect other parameters, specifically <code>arg0</code> and <code>arg2</code>, and how it propagates through the function.<br><br>### Tainted Data Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Input**:<br>   - The <code>params</code> array is tainted, particularly <code>params[0]</code>, which contains a memory reference to the object ID to be deleted.<br><br>2. **Parameter Type Check**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>param_types</code> matches the expected type. If it does not, the function returns early without further processing.<br>   - **Taint Propagation**: No taint propagation occurs here, but if the check fails, the function exits without affecting <code>arg0</code> or <code>arg2</code>.<br><br>3. **Extracting Object ID Size**:<br>   - <code>obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;</code><br>   - The size of the object ID is derived from the tainted <code>params[0]</code>.<br>   - **Taint Propagation**: <code>obj_id_sz</code> is now indirectly tainted.<br><br>4. **Memory Allocation**:<br>   - <code>obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);</code><br>   - Memory is allocated for <code>obj_id</code> based on the tainted size.<br>   - **Taint Propagation**: The allocation itself does not propagate taint, but it prepares for the next step.<br><br>5. **Copying Object ID**:<br>   - <code>TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);</code><br>   - The content of <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> (tainted) is copied into <code>obj_id</code>.<br>   - **Taint Propagation**: <code>obj_id</code> now contains tainted data, as it directly copies from the tainted buffer.<br><br>6. **Opening Persistent Object**:<br>   - <code>res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(...)</code> is called with <code>obj_id</code> (tainted).<br>   - **Taint Propagation**: The function uses the tainted <code>obj_id</code> to attempt to open a persistent object. If this function processes the <code>obj_id</code>, it may lead to further taint propagation.<br><br>### Tracking Tainted Data to <code>arg0</code> and <code>arg2</code><br><br>- **arg0**: <br>  - If <code>arg0</code> is intended to represent the object ID or some related data, it could be directly affected by the tainted <code>obj_id</code>. <br>  - If <code>arg0</code> is assigned or manipulated based on the value of <code>obj_id</code>, it will inherit the taint from <code>params[0]</code>.<br><br>- **arg2**: <br>  - If <code>arg2</code> is used in conjunction with <code>obj_id</code> or is derived from operations involving <code>obj_id</code>, it could also be affected by the tainted data.<br>  - For example, if <code>arg2</code> is used to store the result of an operation that involves <code>obj_id</code>, it will also be tainted.<br><br>### Data Aliases<br>- The <code>params</code> array itself can be seen as a data alias for the memory that is being manipulated. Specifically, <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> is a pointer to the actual data that is being copied into <code>obj_id</code>.<br>- If <code>arg0</code> or <code>arg2</code> are pointers or references to the same memory location as <code>obj_id</code>, they will also be tainted.<br><br>### Tainted Data Operations<br>- The critical operation that propagates taint is the <code>TEE_MemMove</code> function, which copies data from the tainted <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> to <code>obj_id</code>. This operation ensures that any data in <code>params[0]</code> is now present in <code>obj_id</code>, which is then used in subsequent operations.<br>- The call to <code>TEE_OpenPersistentObject</code> uses the tainted <code>obj_id</code>, which could lead to further operations that may expose or manipulate the tainted data.<br><br>### Sinks<br>- The primary sink remains the call to <code>TEE_OpenPersistentObject</code>, which uses the tainted <code>obj_id</code>. If this function processes the <code>obj_id</code> without proper validation, it could lead to security vulnerabilities.<br>- Any subsequent operations that utilize <code>arg0</code> or <code>arg2</code> after they have been assigned or derived from <code>obj_id</code> could also represent sinks for tainted data.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>The <code>delete_object</code> function effectively propagates tainted data from the input parameters to critical operations that could affect the security of the system. The tainted data from <code>params[0]</code> flows into <code>obj_id</code>, which is then used in sensitive operations. If <code>arg0</code> or <code>arg2</code> are derived from or assigned values based on <code>obj_id</code>, they will also inherit the taint. Care should be taken to ensure that all data is validated and sanitized to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

CWE-20: Tainted size `obj_id_sz` derived from `params[0].memref.size` is used in `TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz)` without proper validation, leading to potential out-of-bounds memory allocation in `delete_object()`.

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Function Signature**: 
  ```c
  TEE_Result TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint(void __unused *session,
                                        uint32_t command,
                                        uint32_t param_types,
                                        TEE_Param params[4])
  ```

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as inputs. Both are considered tainted from the start.

2. **Switch Statement**:
   - The function uses a switch statement to determine which command to execute based on the `command` parameter. The `command` parameter is not tainted, but it controls the flow of execution based on the value it holds.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - Each case in the switch statement calls a different function, passing the tainted parameters `param_types` and `params`.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW`**:
     ```c
     return create_raw_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from `param_types` and `params` is propagated to the `create_raw_object` function. If `create_raw_object` uses these parameters, it will also be working with tainted data.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW`**:
     ```c
     return read_raw_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - **Taint Propagation**: Similar to the previous case, the taint from `param_types` and `params` is passed to `read_raw_object`, which will also handle tainted data.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE`**:
     ```c
     return delete_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - **Taint Propagation**: Again, the taint is propagated to `delete_object`, which will process the tainted parameters.

   - **Default Case**:
     ```c
     EMSG(&quot;Command ID 0x%x is not supported&quot;, command);
     return TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED;
     ```
     - In the default case, no tainted data is propagated since the function does not call any other functions or use the tainted parameters.

4. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `params` parameter is an array of `TEE_Param` structures. If any of the elements of this array are pointers or contain pointers, they may introduce additional data aliases. For example, if `TEE_Param` contains a pointer to a buffer, that buffer may also be tainted if it is modified or accessed in the called functions.

5. **Operations that Propagate Taint**:
   - The calls to `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object` are critical points where taint is propagated. If these functions perform any operations on the parameters, they will be working with tainted data.

6. **Implicit Flow**:
   - The control flow of the switch statement is dependent on the value of `command`. If `command` is influenced by user input or external data, it can lead to different paths being taken, which may affect the overall security of the function. However, since `command` itself is not tainted, it does not directly propagate taint.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Inputs**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Tainted Outputs**: The return values of `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object` may also be tainted depending on their implementations.
- **Data Aliases**: Potentially exist within the `TEE_Param` structure, depending on its definition.
- **Taint Propagation**: Occurs through function calls in the switch statement.
- **Control Dependencies**: The flow of execution is controlled by the `command` parameter, which can lead to different handling of tainted data.

### Conclusion
The `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function effectively propagates tainted data through its parameters to other functions based on the command received. Care should be taken in the implementation of the called functions to ensure that they handle tainted data securely.</pre>

<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: delete_object</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `delete_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` flows through the function, identify any new taint propagation, and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (specifically, `params[0].memref.buffer`)

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as inputs. The `params` array is tainted, specifically the first element `params[0]`, which contains a memory reference (`memref`).

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   ```c
   if (param_types != exp_param_types)
       return TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS;
   ```
   - The function checks if the `param_types` matches the expected types. If it does not match, the function returns an error. This check does not affect taint propagation.

3. **Extracting Object ID Size**:
   ```c
   obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;
   ```
   - The size of the object ID is taken from the tainted `params[0].memref.size`. This variable (`obj_id_sz`) is now derived from tainted data.

4. **Memory Allocation**:
   ```c
   obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);
   if (!obj_id)
       return TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
   ```
   - Memory is allocated for `obj_id` based on the size derived from tainted data. If the allocation fails, the function returns an error. The allocated memory itself is not tainted yet.

5. **Copying Tainted Data**:
   ```c
   TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);
   ```
   - The function copies data from `params[0].memref.buffer` (tainted) to `obj_id`. This operation propagates the taint to `obj_id`, meaning that `obj_id` now contains tainted data.

6. **Opening Persistent Object**:
   ```c
   res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(TEE_STORAGE_PRIVATE,
                                  obj_id, obj_id_sz,
                                  TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_READ |
                                  TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_WRITE_META,
                                  &amp;object);
   ```
   - The function attempts to open a persistent object using the tainted `obj_id` and its size. If `obj_id` contains sensitive information, this could lead to security issues if not handled properly. The result of this operation (`res`) may also be influenced by the tainted data.

7. **Error Handling**:
   ```c
   if (res != TEE_SUCCESS) {
       EMSG(&quot;Failed to open persistent object, res=0x%08x&quot;, res);
       TEE_Free(obj_id);
       return res;
   }
   ```
   - If the object cannot be opened, an error message is logged, and the function returns. The taint does not propagate further in this case.

8. **Closing and Deleting the Object**:
   ```c
   TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(object);
   ```
   - This function call does not directly involve tainted data but operates on the `object` handle obtained from the previous step.

9. **Freeing Memory**:
   ```c
   TEE_Free(obj_id);
   ```
   - The allocated memory for `obj_id` is freed. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.

10. **Return Statement**:
    ```c
    return res;
    ```
    - The function returns the result of the operation, which may be influenced by the tainted data.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Input**: `params[0].memref.buffer` is tainted.
- **Tainted Variables**: 
  - `obj_id_sz` is derived from tainted data.
  - `obj_id` becomes tainted after copying from `params[0].memref.buffer`.
- **Taint Propagation**: 
  - Taint is propagated when copying data to `obj_id`.
  - The call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` uses tainted data (`obj_id`).
- **Sinks**: 
  - The function `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` can be considered a sink since it operates on potentially sensitive data. If the object ID is derived from user input, it could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of persistent objects.

### Conclusion
The `delete_object` function effectively propagates tainted data from the `params` input through to the `obj_id`, which is then used in a critical operation that could affect security. Care should be taken to validate and sanitize the data before using it in sensitive operations like opening persistent objects.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_Malloc</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_Malloc` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `arg0` (which is derived from the size of the object ID in the previous function) flows through this function. Since the implementation of `TEE_Malloc` is unavailable, we will focus on the conceptual aspects of taint propagation and potential sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `arg0` (which corresponds to `obj_id_sz` from the `delete_object` function)

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The `TEE_Malloc` function is called with `arg0` as the size parameter for memory allocation. This size is derived from the tainted data `params[0].memref.size`, which was previously determined to be tainted.

2. **Memory Allocation**:
   - The purpose of `TEE_Malloc` is to allocate a block of memory of size `arg0`. Since `arg0` is tainted, the allocation request is based on potentially untrusted data. 

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - If `TEE_Malloc` successfully allocates memory, the pointer returned (let&#x27;s denote it as `ptr`) will point to a memory region that is allocated based on tainted input. Therefore, the allocated memory is considered tainted as it is based on the size derived from potentially untrusted data.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If `TEE_Malloc` fails to allocate memory (e.g., due to insufficient memory), it typically returns a null pointer. The calling function (`delete_object`) checks for this null pointer and handles it appropriately by returning an error. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The return value of `TEE_Malloc` (the pointer to the allocated memory) is tainted if the allocation is successful. This tainted pointer is then used in subsequent operations in the calling function.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Input**: `arg0` (size for allocation) is tainted.
- **Tainted Output**: 
  - The pointer returned by `TEE_Malloc` (let&#x27;s call it `ptr`) is tainted if the allocation is successful.
- **Taint Propagation**: 
  - The taint is propagated through the allocation process, as the size is derived from tainted data.
- **Sinks**: 
  - The allocated memory (`ptr`) can be considered a sink if it is used in subsequent operations that could expose sensitive data or lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, if the memory is later written to or read from without proper validation, it could lead to issues.

### Conclusion
The `TEE_Malloc` function propagates taint from the size parameter to the allocated memory pointer. The taint is significant because it originates from user-controlled input, which could lead to vulnerabilities if not handled properly. The allocated memory is tainted and should be treated with caution in subsequent operations to prevent security issues.</pre>

To analyze the <code>delete_object</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>params</code> (from the previous function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>) flows through this function.

To analyze the <code>TEE_Malloc</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>arg0</code> (which represents the size of the memory to be allocated, derived from the tainted <code>params</code> in the previous function) flows through this function. Since the implementation of <code>TEE_Malloc</code> is not provided, we will make assumptions based on typical memory allocation behavior.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- **Tainted Input**: <code>arg0</code> (the size of memory to allocate, which is derived from <code>params[0].memref.size</code> in the <code>delete_object</code> function)<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Function Entry**:<br>   - The function <code>TEE_Malloc</code> is called with <code>arg0</code> as the size of the memory to allocate. This size is derived from the tainted <code>params[0]</code>, which means <code>arg0</code> is also tainted.<br><br>2. **Memory Allocation**:<br>   - The purpose of <code>TEE_Malloc</code> is to allocate a block of memory of size <code>arg0</code>. The taint analysis here focuses on whether the allocation process itself propagates taint or if it introduces any new variables that could carry taint.<br><br>3. **Return Value**:<br>   - The return value of <code>TEE_Malloc</code> is a pointer to the allocated memory. If the allocation is successful, this pointer can be considered tainted because it is associated with the size that was derived from tainted data. If the allocation fails, the function typically returns <code>NULL</code>, which does not carry taint.<br><br>### Taint Propagation<br>- **Tainted Input**: <code>arg0</code> (size of memory to allocate)<br>- **Tainted Output**: <br>  - The pointer returned by <code>TEE_Malloc</code> (let&#x27;s denote it as <code>ptr</code>) is tainted because it is allocated based on the tainted size <code>arg0</code>. This pointer will hold the allocated memory, which may later be used to store tainted data.<br><br>### Sinks<br>- **Potential Sinks**: <br>  - The tainted pointer returned by <code>TEE_Malloc</code> can be considered a sink if it is used in subsequent operations that involve reading from or writing to the allocated memory. For example, if the allocated memory is later populated with data from a tainted source or used in a sensitive operation, it could lead to security vulnerabilities.<br><br>### Summary<br>- **Tainted Input**: <code>arg0</code> (size of memory to allocate)<br>- **Tainted Output**: The pointer returned by <code>TEE_Malloc</code> is tainted because it is based on the tainted size.<br>- **Sinks**: The tainted pointer can lead to potential sinks in subsequent operations that manipulate the allocated memory.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>The <code>TEE_Malloc</code> function propagates taint from the input size <code>arg0</code> to the pointer it returns. While the function itself does not perform any operations on the data, the tainted pointer it returns can be used in later operations that may involve sensitive data handling. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that any data written to or read from this allocated memory is properly validated to prevent security issues. Further analysis of how this pointer is used in subsequent functions would be necessary to fully understand the implications of the taint propagation.

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `param_types` and `params` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Function Signature**: 
  ```c
  TEE_Result TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint(void __unused *session,
                                        uint32_t command,
                                        uint32_t param_types,
                                        TEE_Param params[4])
  ```

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as parameters. Both are considered tainted upon entry.

2. **Switch Statement**:
   - The function uses a switch statement to determine which command to execute based on the `command` parameter.
   - The `command` parameter is not tainted, but it controls the flow of execution, which can lead to tainted data being processed in different cases.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW**:
     - Calls `create_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
     - Both `param_types` and `params` are passed to this function, maintaining their taint.
   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW**:
     - Calls `read_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
     - Again, both `param_types` and `params` are passed, preserving their taint.
   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE**:
     - Calls `delete_object(param_types, params)`.
     - Both parameters are passed, and their taint is preserved.
   - **Default Case**:
     - Logs an error message but does not propagate taint since it does not call any function that uses the tainted parameters.

### Data Aliases
- **Data Aliases**:
  - The `params` parameter is an array of `TEE_Param` structures. Each element of this array can be accessed and modified, which means that any modifications to `params[i]` (where `i` is an index from 0 to 3) can affect the taint status of the data within those structures.
  - If any of the functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`) modify the contents of `params`, the taint will propagate through those modifications.

### Operations Propagating Taint
- The function does not perform any direct assignments or operations that would create new variables. However, the calls to the other functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`) are critical as they may perform operations on the tainted parameters.
- If any of these functions return a result that depends on the tainted data, the taint will propagate through their return values.

### Implicit Data Flow
- The control flow of the switch statement is dependent on the `command` parameter. While `command` itself is not tainted, it determines which function is called with the tainted parameters. Thus, the control dependency on `command` can lead to different paths of tainted data being processed.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Data**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Flow**:
  - Tainted data enters the function.
  - Depending on the value of `command`, the tainted data is passed to one of three functions.
  - The taint is preserved as it flows through the function calls.
  - Any modifications to `params` within the called functions will maintain or propagate the taint.

### Conclusion
The `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function effectively propagates tainted data through its parameters to other functions based on the command provided. Care should be taken in the implementation of `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object` to ensure that they handle the tainted data appropriately, as any modifications to `params` could lead to security vulnerabilities if not properly managed.</pre>

<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: delete_object</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `delete_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (specifically `params[0]`) flows through the function. We will identify any new taint propagation, check if tainted data reaches any sinks, and note any operations that may affect the taint status.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (specifically `params[0]`)

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as parameters. The `params` array is tainted, specifically `params[0]`, which is expected to contain a memory reference.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   - The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected value (`exp_param_types`).
   - If the check fails, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`. This does not propagate taint since it does not process the tainted data.

3. **Extracting Object ID Size**:
   - The size of the object ID is obtained from `params[0].memref.size`. This value is derived from the tainted `params[0]`, so it is also tainted.

4. **Memory Allocation**:
   - The function allocates memory for `obj_id` using `TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0)`. 
   - If the allocation fails, it returns `TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`. The `obj_id` variable itself is not tainted at this point, but it will hold tainted data if the allocation is successful.

5. **Copying Tainted Data**:
   - The function uses `TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz)` to copy the contents of the buffer from `params[0]` into `obj_id`.
   - This operation propagates the taint from `params[0]` to `obj_id`. After this operation, `obj_id` contains tainted data.

6. **Opening Persistent Object**:
   - The function calls `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` with `obj_id`, which now contains tainted data. The parameters passed to this function are:
     - `TEE_STORAGE_PRIVATE`
     - `obj_id` (tainted)
     - `obj_id_sz` (tainted size)
     - `TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_READ | TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_WRITE_META`
   - If `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` fails, it logs an error message and frees the allocated memory for `obj_id`, returning the result `res`. The taint is still present in the context of the function.

7. **Closing and Deleting Persistent Object**:
   - If `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` is successful, the function calls `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(object)`. This function is expected to operate on the object handle obtained from the previous call, which is not directly tainted but is derived from the tainted `obj_id`.

8. **Freeing Memory**:
   - The function frees the memory allocated for `obj_id` using `TEE_Free(obj_id)`. This does not affect the taint status but cleans up the allocated memory.

9. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns the result `res`, which may indicate success or failure based on the operations performed. The taint does not propagate beyond this point since the return value does not directly expose the tainted data.

### Taint Propagation Summary
- **Tainted Data**: 
  - `params[0]` is tainted upon entry.
  - `obj_id_sz` is derived from `params[0]` and is tainted.
  - `obj_id` becomes tainted after copying data from `params[0]`.
  
- **Flow**:
  - Tainted data flows from `params[0]` to `obj_id` through the `TEE_MemMove` operation.
  - The taint is propagated to the `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` function call.

### Sinks
- **Sinks**:
  - The primary sink in this function is the call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject`, which uses the tainted `obj_id`. If this function processes the tainted data in a way that could lead to security issues (e.g., unauthorized access or deletion of sensitive data), it represents a potential vulnerability.
  - The logging of the error message with `EMSG` also indirectly exposes the tainted data if the error message includes the tainted result.

### Conclusion
The `delete_object` function effectively propagates tainted data from `params[0]` to `obj_id`, which is then used in a critical operation (`TEE_OpenPersistentObject`). Care should be taken to ensure that the handling of this tainted data does not lead to security vulnerabilities, especially in the context of object deletion and access control. Proper validation and sanitization of the input data are essential to mitigate risks associated with tainted data.</pre>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To continue the taint analysis, we will focus on the `TEE_MemMove` function, which is called within the `delete_object` function. We will analyze how tainted data can affect the parameters `arg0` and `arg2` (indices [0, 2]) in the context of `TEE_MemMove`. Since the implementation of `TEE_MemMove` is unavailable, we will make assumptions based on typical behavior of memory manipulation functions.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params[0]` (specifically, `params[0].memref.buffer` and `params[0].memref.size`)

### Taint Flow Analysis for `TEE_MemMove`

1. **Function Call**:
   - The `delete_object` function calls `TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz)`.
   - Here, `obj_id` is the destination buffer, `params[0].memref.buffer` is the source buffer, and `obj_id_sz` is the size of the data to be copied.

2. **Tainted Data Propagation**:
   - The source buffer `params[0].memref.buffer` is tainted because it originates from the tainted `params[0]`.
   - The size `obj_id_sz` is also tainted as it is derived from `params[0].memref.size`.
   - When `TEE_MemMove` is executed, it copies the contents from the tainted source buffer to the destination buffer (`obj_id`), thus propagating the taint to `obj_id`.

3. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `obj_id` variable is a pointer that now holds a reference to the tainted data copied from `params[0].memref.buffer`.
   - If `TEE_MemMove` modifies the contents of `obj_id`, it will directly affect the tainted data.

### Tracking Tainted Data to Parameters `arg0` and `arg2`

Assuming `TEE_MemMove` is a function that could potentially affect multiple parameters (like `arg0` and `arg2`), we need to consider how tainted data could reach these parameters.

1. **Parameter `arg0`**:
   - If `TEE_MemMove` is designed to copy data into a structure or object that is later referenced by `arg0`, then `arg0` could become tainted.
   - For example, if `arg0` is a pointer to a structure that includes `obj_id` or is initialized with the contents of `obj_id`, then `arg0` would inherit the taint from `obj_id`.

2. **Parameter `arg2`**:
   - Similarly, if `arg2` is affected by the contents of `obj_id` (for instance, if it is used to store or process the same data that was copied into `obj_id`), then it could also become tainted.
   - If `TEE_MemMove` is used in a way that modifies a shared buffer or a global state that `arg2` references, then `arg2` would also be tainted.

### Potential Sinks
- If `arg0` or `arg2` are used in subsequent operations that involve sensitive actions (like accessing secure storage, performing cryptographic operations, etc.), the taint could lead to vulnerabilities.
- For example, if `arg0` is passed to another function that performs operations based on its contents, and those contents are tainted, it could lead to unauthorized access or data leakage.

### Conclusion
The `TEE_MemMove` function plays a critical role in propagating tainted data from `params[0]` to `obj_id`. The taint can further propagate to parameters like `arg0` and `arg2` if they are influenced by the contents of `obj_id`. It is essential to ensure that any operations involving these parameters are carefully validated to prevent security vulnerabilities stemming from tainted data. Proper checks and sanitization should be implemented to mitigate risks associated with the use of tainted data in sensitive operations.</pre>

To analyze the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.<br><br>### Tainted Parameters<br>- **Tainted Parameters**: <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;params&gt;</code><br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> takes four parameters:<br>1. <code>session</code>: Unused in this analysis.<br>2. <code>command</code>: A command identifier.<br>3. <code>param_types</code>: Tainted parameter.<br>4. <code>params</code>: Tainted parameter (array of <code>TEE_Param</code>).<br><br>### Control Flow Analysis<br>The function uses a switch statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of <code>command</code>. The commands correspond to different operations that utilize the tainted parameters.<br><br>### Taint Data Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> are initially tainted.<br><br>2. **Switch Statement**:<br>   - The <code>command</code> variable is not tainted, but it controls which case is executed. The flow of taint depends on the value of <code>command</code>.<br><br>3. **Case Analysis**:<br>   - **Case <code>TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>create_raw_object(param_types, params)</code>.<br>     - **Taint Propagation**: Both <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> are passed to this function, propagating the taint.<br>   <br>   - **Case <code>TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>read_raw_object(param_types, params)</code>.<br>     - **Taint Propagation**: Again, both <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> are passed, propagating the taint.<br>   <br>   - **Case <code>TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>delete_object(param_types, params)</code>.<br>     - **Taint Propagation**: Both parameters are passed, propagating the taint.<br><br>4. **Default Case**:<br>   - If <code>command</code> does not match any of the specified cases, it logs an error message and returns <code>TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED</code>.<br>   - **Taint Propagation**: No taint propagation occurs here since no tainted parameters are used.<br><br>### Data Aliases<br>- The <code>params</code> parameter is an array of <code>TEE_Param</code>, which may contain pointers or references to other data structures.

However, the calls to the other functions (<code>create_raw_object</code>, <code>read_raw_object</code>, <code>delete_object</code>) are critical as they may manipulate the tainted data.<br><br>### Implicit Flow<br>- The control flow through the switch statement is dependent on the value of <code>command</code>.

To continue the taint analysis based on the previous results, we will focus on how tainted data can affect multiple parameters, specifically <code>arg0</code> and <code>arg2</code>, in the context of the <code>delete_object</code> function. We will also pay attention to data aliases and tainted data operations.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The <code>delete_object</code> function processes the <code>params</code> array, particularly <code>params[0]</code>, which is tainted.

This operation ensures that any data in <code>params[0]</code> is now present in <code>obj_id</code>, which is then used in subsequent operations.<br>- The call to <code>TEE_OpenPersistentObject</code> uses the tainted <code>obj_id</code>, which could lead to further operations that may expose or manipulate the tainted data.<br><br>### Sinks<br>- The primary sink remains the call to <code>TEE_OpenPersistentObject</code>, which uses the tainted <code>obj_id</code>.

CWE-20: Tainted data from `params[0]` and `params[1]` reaches `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` through `obj_id` and `obj_id_sz` without proper validation of their contents, allowing for potential exploitation. The lack of checks on the size and content of `params` means that malicious input could lead to improper object creation or memory issues.</pre></div>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Function Signature**: 
  ```c
  TEE_Result TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint(void __unused *session,
                                        uint32_t command,
                                        uint32_t param_types,
                                        TEE_Param params[4])
  ```

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as parameters. Both are considered tainted upon entry.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which command to execute based on the `command` parameter. The `command` parameter is not tainted, but it controls which branch of the code will execute, thus creating an implicit flow dependency.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW**:
     - Calls `create_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
     - **Taint Propagation**: Both `param_types` and `params` are passed to this function, maintaining their taint.
   
   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW**:
     - Calls `read_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
     - **Taint Propagation**: Again, `param_types` and `params` are passed, preserving their taint.

   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE**:
     - Calls `delete_object(param_types, params)`.
     - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from `param_types` and `params` is carried over to this function call.

4. **Default Case**:
   - If the `command` does not match any of the specified cases, an error message is logged, and the function returns `TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: No taint is propagated in this case since it does not call any other functions that use the tainted parameters.

### Data Aliases
- **Parameters**: 
  - `params` is an array of `TEE_Param`, which may contain pointers or references to other data structures. If any of the elements in `params` are modified within the called functions, the taint could propagate through those modifications.
  
### Operations that Propagate Taint
- The function calls to `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object` propagate the taint from `param_types` and `params` to the respective function calls. The actual propagation of taint within those functions would need to be analyzed separately.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- **Entry**: `param_types` and `params` are tainted.
- **Control Dependency**: The `command` parameter determines which function is called, creating an implicit flow.
- **Explicit Data Flow**: Tainted parameters are passed to the respective functions in each case.
- **Data Aliases**: The `params` array may contain references to other data, which could also be tainted if modified.
- **No Taint Propagation**: In the default case, no taint is propagated.

### Conclusion
The `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function effectively propagates taint from its parameters to the called functions based on the command provided. The analysis indicates that the taint remains intact through the function calls, and any modifications to the `params` array within those functions could further propagate taint to other parts of the application. Further analysis of the called functions is necessary to fully understand the implications of taint propagation.</pre>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `create_raw_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` flows through the function, identify any new taint propagation, and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

- **Tainted Input**: `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`)

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as parameters. The `params` array is tainted upon entry.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   - The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected `exp_param_types`. If they do not match, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: If the check fails, no taint is propagated further. If it passes, the function continues with tainted data.

3. **Extracting Object ID**:
   - `obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;`
     - The size of the first parameter is extracted. This is a direct use of tainted data.
   - `obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);`
     - Memory is allocated for `obj_id`. The allocation itself does not propagate taint.
   - `TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);`
     - The content of `params[0].memref.buffer` is copied to `obj_id`. This operation propagates the taint from `params[0]` to `obj_id`.

4. **Extracting Data**:
   - `data_sz = params[1].memref.size;`
     - The size of the second parameter is extracted, which is also tainted.
   - `data = TEE_Malloc(data_sz, 0);`
     - Memory is allocated for `data`. No taint propagation occurs here.
   - `TEE_MemMove(data, params[1].memref.buffer, data_sz);`
     - The content of `params[1].memref.buffer` is copied to `data`. This operation propagates the taint from `params[1]` to `data`.

5. **Creating Persistent Object**:
   - The function calls `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` with `obj_id`, `obj_id_sz`, and `obj_data_flag`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The `obj_id` is tainted because it was derived from `params[0]`. However, the result of this function call (`res`) does not propagate taint further.

6. **Writing Object Data**:
   - The function calls `TEE_WriteObjectData(object, data, data_sz);`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The `data` variable is tainted as it was derived from `params[1]`. This means that the data being written to the object is tainted.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - If `TEE_WriteObjectData` fails, an error message is logged, and the object is closed and deleted. The taint does not propagate further in this case.
   - If successful, the object is closed, and the function returns the result.

8. **Memory Cleanup**:
   - The function frees the allocated memory for `obj_id` and `data`. This does not affect taint propagation.

### Sinks
- **Sinks Identified**:
  - The tainted data reaches the following sinks:
    - `TEE_WriteObjectData(object, data, data_sz);`: This is a critical sink where tainted data is written to a persistent object. If the data in `params[1]` is untrusted, it could lead to security vulnerabilities.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- **Entry**: `params` is tainted.
- **Parameter Type Check**: If the check fails, no further taint propagation occurs.
- **Taint Propagation**:
  - `obj_id` becomes tainted from `params[0]`.
  - `data` becomes tainted from `params[1]`.
- **Sinks**: Tainted data is written to a persistent object via `TEE_WriteObjectData`, which is a critical point for potential vulnerabilities.
- **Memory Cleanup**: No impact on taint propagation.

### Conclusion
The `create_raw_object` function effectively propagates taint from the `params` input to the `obj_id` and `data` variables. The critical sink is the `TEE_WriteObjectData` function, where tainted data is written to a persistent object. This could pose a security risk if the data is not properly validated before being written. Further analysis of the `TEE_WriteObjectData` function and the integrity of the data in `params` is necessary to assess the overall security implications.</pre>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To continue the taint analysis, we will focus on the external function `TEE_CreatePersistentObject`, which is called within the `create_raw_object` function. We will track how tainted data could potentially affect its parameters, particularly focusing on the parameters `obj_id`, `obj_id_sz`, and `obj_data_flag`. We will also consider how tainted data could reach other parameters, specifically `arg1` and `arg2`, which correspond to the indices [1, 2] in the context of the `params` array.

### Tainted Data Overview
- **Tainted Input**: 
  - `params[0]` (used to derive `obj_id`)
  - `params[1]` (used to derive `data`)
- **Tainted Variables**:
  - `obj_id` (derived from `params[0]`)
  - `data` (derived from `params[1]`)

### Function Call: TEE_CreatePersistentObject
The function signature for `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` is assumed to be something like this (exact signature may vary):
```c
TEE_Result TEE_CreatePersistentObject(uint32_t storageID,
                                      char *objectID,
                                      size_t objectIDSize,
                                      uint32_t dataFlags,
                                      TEE_ObjectHandle handle,
                                      void *data,
                                      size_t dataSize,
                                      TEE_ObjectHandle *object);
```

### Parameter Analysis
1. **Parameters Passed to TEE_CreatePersistentObject**:
   - `storageID`: This is a constant value (`TEE_STORAGE_PRIVATE`) and is not tainted.
   - `objectID`: This is `obj_id`, which is tainted because it is derived from `params[0]`.
   - `objectIDSize`: This is `obj_id_sz`, which is derived from the size of `params[0].memref.size` and is not tainted directly but is based on the tainted `params[0]`.
   - `dataFlags`: This is a combination of flags and is not tainted.
   - `handle`: This is `TEE_HANDLE_NULL`, which is not tainted.
   - `data`: This is `NULL`, which is not tainted.
   - `dataSize`: This is `0`, which is not tainted.
   - `object`: This is a pointer to `TEE_ObjectHandle`, which will be populated by the function.

### Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Data**:
  - The `obj_id` parameter is tainted because it is derived from `params[0]`, which is tainted. This means that any operations performed on the object created with this ID could be influenced by untrusted data.
  - The `objectIDSize` is indirectly affected by tainted data since it is derived from the size of `params[0]`. If `params[0]` contains malicious data, it could lead to improper handling of the object ID size.

### Potential Impact on `arg1` and `arg2`
- **arg1 (objectID)**:
  - Since `arg1` corresponds to `objectID`, it is directly affected by tainted data. If `params[0]` contains malicious data, it could lead to the creation of an object with an invalid or malicious ID, which could be exploited later in the application.

- **arg2 (objectIDSize)**:
  - `arg2` corresponds to `objectIDSize`, which is derived from `obj_id_sz`. If `params[0]` is tainted and has an unexpected size, it could lead to buffer overflows or other vulnerabilities when the object ID is processed.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- **Entry**: The function `create_raw_object` receives tainted `params`.
- **Tainted Variables**:
  - `obj_id` is tainted from `params[0]`.
  - `obj_id_sz` is derived from the size of `params[0]` and is indirectly affected by taint.
- **Function Call**: 
  - `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` is called with `obj_id` (tainted) and `obj_id_sz` (indirectly tainted).
- **Potential Vulnerabilities**:
  - If `params[0]` contains malicious data, it could lead to the creation of a persistent object with an invalid ID or size, which could be exploited in subsequent operations.

### Conclusion
The `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` function is a critical point where tainted data can lead to security vulnerabilities. The `obj_id` and `obj_id_sz` parameters are directly influenced by the tainted `params` input, which could result in the creation of objects that are not properly validated. It is essential to ensure that the data in `params` is sanitized and validated before being used in such critical operations to prevent potential attacks. Further analysis of the `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` function&#x27;s implementation would be necessary to fully understand the implications of tainted data at this point in the call chain.</pre>

Both are considered tainted upon entry.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function uses a <code>switch</code> statement to determine which command to execute based on the <code>command</code> parameter. The <code>command</code> parameter is not tainted, but it controls which branch of the code will execute, thus creating an implicit flow dependency.<br><br>3. **Case Analysis**:<br>   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW**:<br>     - Calls <code>create_raw_object(param_types, params)</code>.<br>     - **Taint Propagation**: Both <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> are passed to this function, maintaining their taint.<br>   <br>   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW**:<br>     - Calls <code>read_raw_object(param_types, params)</code>.<br>     - **Taint Propagation**: Again, <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> are passed, preserving their taint.<br><br>   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE**:<br>     - Calls <code>delete_object(param_types, params)</code>.<br>     - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> is carried over to this function call.<br><br>4. **Default Case**:<br>   - If the <code>command</code> does not match any of the specified cases, an error message is logged, and the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED</code>.<br>   - **Taint Propagation**: No taint is propagated in this case since it does not call any other functions that use the tainted parameters.<br><br>### Data Aliases<br>- **Parameters**: <br>  - <code>params</code> is an array of <code>TEE_Param</code>, which may contain pointers or references to other data structures.

If <code>params[0]</code> is tainted and has an unexpected size, it could lead to buffer overflows or other vulnerabilities when the object ID is processed.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- **Entry**: The function <code>create_raw_object</code> receives tainted <code>params</code>.<br>- **Tainted Variables**:<br>  - <code>obj_id</code> is tainted from <code>params[0]</code>.<br>  - <code>obj_id_sz</code> is derived from the size of <code>params[0]</code> and is indirectly affected by taint.<br>- **Function Call**: <br>  - <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code> is called with <code>obj_id</code> (tainted) and <code>obj_id_sz</code> (indirectly tainted).<br>- **Potential Vulnerabilities**:<br>  - If <code>params[0]</code> contains malicious data, it could lead to the creation of a persistent object with an invalid ID or size, which could be exploited in subsequent operations.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>The <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code> function is a critical point where tainted data can lead to security vulnerabilities. The <code>obj_id</code> and <code>obj_id_sz</code> parameters are directly influenced by the tainted <code>params</code> input, which could result in the creation of objects that are not properly validated. It is essential to ensure that the data in <code>params</code> is sanitized and validated before being used in such critical operations to prevent potential attacks. Further analysis of the <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code> function&#x27;s implementation would be necessary to fully understand the implications of tainted data at this point in the call chain.

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Function Signature**: 
  ```c
  TEE_Result TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint(void __unused *session,
                                        uint32_t command,
                                        uint32_t param_types,
                                        TEE_Param params[4])
  ```

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as parameters. Both are considered tainted upon entry.

2. **Switch Statement**:
   - The function uses a switch statement to determine which command to execute based on the `command` parameter. The `command` parameter is not tainted, but it controls the flow of execution.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - Each case in the switch statement calls a different function, passing the tainted parameters `param_types` and `params`.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW`**:
     ```c
     return create_raw_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - Tainted data (`param_types`, `params`) is passed to `create_raw_object`. The taint propagates to this function.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW`**:
     ```c
     return read_raw_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - Tainted data is passed to `read_raw_object`. The taint propagates to this function.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE`**:
     ```c
     return delete_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - Tainted data is passed to `delete_object`. The taint propagates to this function.

   - **Default Case**:
     ```c
     EMSG(&quot;Command ID 0x%x is not supported&quot;, command);
     return TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED;
     ```
     - In the default case, no tainted data is used, and the function simply logs an error message and returns an error code. No taint propagation occurs here.

### Data Aliases
- **Parameters**:
  - `params` is an array of `TEE_Param`, which may contain pointers or references to other data structures. If any of the `TEE_Param` elements are modified within the called functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`), the taint may propagate further.

### Operations that Propagate Taint
- The taint propagates through the function calls to `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object`. The exact nature of how taint is handled in these functions would need to be analyzed separately to determine if they further propagate taint or sanitize the input.

### Implicit Flow
- The control flow is dependent on the value of `command`. If `command` is not one of the expected values, the function does not propagate taint, as it does not call any of the functions that handle tainted data.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Entry**: `param_types`, `params` are tainted upon entry.
- **Taint Propagation**: 
  - Taint is passed to `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object` based on the value of `command`.
- **No Taint Propagation**: In the default case, no taint is propagated as it does not involve the tainted parameters.

### Conclusion
The `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function effectively propagates tainted data through its control flow based on the command provided. The actual handling of the taint in the called functions would need to be examined to fully understand the security implications.</pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: delete_object</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `delete_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (specifically `params[0]`) flows through the function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (specifically `params[0]`)

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as parameters. The tainted data is `params`, specifically `params[0]`, which is expected to be a memory reference containing the object ID to be deleted.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   ```c
   if (param_types != exp_param_types)
       return TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS;
   ```
   - The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected parameter types. If it does not match, the function returns an error. This check does not affect taint propagation.

3. **Extracting Object ID Size**:
   ```c
   obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;
   ```
   - The size of the object ID is extracted from the tainted `params[0]`. The variable `obj_id_sz` is now tainted because it is derived from tainted data.

4. **Memory Allocation**:
   ```c
   obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);
   if (!obj_id)
       return TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
   ```
   - Memory is allocated for `obj_id` based on the tainted size `obj_id_sz`. If the allocation fails, the function returns an error. The `obj_id` pointer itself is not tainted at this point, but it will hold tainted data in the next step.

5. **Copying Data**:
   ```c
   TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);
   ```
   - The function copies data from the tainted buffer `params[0].memref.buffer` into `obj_id`. This operation propagates the taint from `params[0]` to `obj_id`. Now, `obj_id` contains tainted data.

6. **Opening Persistent Object**:
   ```c
   res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(TEE_STORAGE_PRIVATE,
                                  obj_id, obj_id_sz,
                                  TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_READ |
                                  TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_WRITE_META,
                                  &amp;object);
   ```
   - The function attempts to open a persistent object using the tainted `obj_id` and `obj_id_sz`. This is a critical point where tainted data reaches a sink (the persistent object store). If the object ID is derived from untrusted input, this could lead to security vulnerabilities.

7. **Error Handling**:
   ```c
   if (res != TEE_SUCCESS) {
       EMSG(&quot;Failed to open persistent object, res=0x%08x&quot;, res);
       TEE_Free(obj_id);
       return res;
   }
   ```
   - If the object cannot be opened, an error message is logged, and the function returns an error. The taint does not propagate further in this case.

8. **Closing and Deleting the Object**:
   ```c
   TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(object);
   ```
   - If the object is successfully opened, it is then closed and deleted. The taint from `obj_id` has already reached a sink, and this operation does not introduce new taint.

9. **Freeing Memory**:
   ```c
   TEE_Free(obj_id);
   ```
   - The allocated memory for `obj_id` is freed. This does not affect taint propagation.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Entry**: `params[0]` is tainted upon entry.
- **Taint Propagation**:
  - `obj_id_sz` becomes tainted from `params[0].memref.size`.
  - `obj_id` becomes tainted after copying from `params[0].memref.buffer`.
  - The taint reaches a sink when `obj_id` is used in `TEE_OpenPersistentObject`.

### Sinks
- The tainted data reaches a sink at the call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject`, which interacts with persistent storage. This is a critical point where untrusted data could lead to security issues if not properly validated.

### Conclusion
The `delete_object` function propagates tainted data from `params[0]` through to a critical sink in the form of a persistent object store operation. Proper validation and sanitization of the input data are essential to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.</pre>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_Free` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `arg0` (which is the pointer to the memory allocated in the previous function, `delete_object`) flows through this function. Since the implementation of `TEE_Free` is not provided, we will make some assumptions based on typical memory management functions.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `arg0` (the pointer to the memory allocated for `obj_id` in `delete_object`)

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function `TEE_Free` is called with `arg0`, which is a pointer to the memory that was allocated for `obj_id` in the `delete_object` function. This memory is tainted because it was derived from the tainted input `params[0]`.

2. **Memory Deallocation**:
   - The purpose of `TEE_Free` is to deallocate memory that was previously allocated (in this case, the memory pointed to by `arg0`). The function typically does not return any value or propagate data further; it simply frees the memory.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - Since `TEE_Free` is a memory management function, it does not perform any operations that would propagate taint to new variables or data structures. The taint associated with `arg0` does not propagate beyond this function because the function&#x27;s purpose is solely to release memory.

4. **Sinks**:
   - There are no sinks in the `TEE_Free` function itself. The function does not interact with any external systems or perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities. It simply frees the memory that was allocated.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Entry**: `arg0` is tainted upon entry, as it points to memory that was derived from tainted data in the `delete_object` function.
- **Taint Propagation**: 
  - There is no new taint propagation within `TEE_Free`. The function does not create new variables or perform operations that would carry taint forward.
- **Sinks**: 
  - There are no sinks in `TEE_Free`. The function does not expose or utilize the tainted data in a way that could lead to security issues.

### Conclusion
The `TEE_Free` function does not propagate taint beyond its entry point, as its sole purpose is to deallocate memory. While it does handle tainted data, it does not introduce any new vulnerabilities or propagate taint further. The taint analysis for this function indicates that it is safe in terms of taint propagation, but it is essential to ensure that the data being freed was properly managed and validated before reaching this point.</pre>

To analyze the <code>TEE_Free</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>arg0</code> (which is the pointer to the memory allocated in the previous function) flows through this function. Since the implementation of <code>TEE_Free</code> is not provided, we will focus on the conceptual aspects of taint propagation and potential sinks.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- **Tainted Input**: <code>arg0</code> (the pointer to the memory allocated for <code>obj_id</code> in the <code>delete_object</code> function)<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The <code>TEE_Free</code> function is typically used to deallocate memory that was previously allocated. In this context, it is called to free the memory pointed to by <code>obj_id</code>, which contains potentially tainted data.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Tainted Input**:<br>   - The input to <code>TEE_Free</code> is <code>arg0</code>, which is a pointer to the memory that was allocated and populated with tainted data from <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> in the <code>delete_object</code> function.<br><br>2. **Memory Deallocation**:<br>   - The primary purpose of <code>TEE_Free</code> is to release the memory allocated for <code>obj_id</code>. The function itself does not process or manipulate the contents of the memory; it simply frees the allocated block.<br>   - Since <code>TEE_Free</code> does not perform any operations on the data itself, there is no new taint propagation within this function. The taint does not change or propagate further; it simply exists in the memory that is being freed.<br><br>3. **Sinks**:<br>   - The <code>TEE_Free</code> function is not a sink in the traditional sense of data flow analysis, as it does not perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities or data leakage. Its role is limited to memory management.<br>   - However, it is important to note that if the memory being freed contained sensitive or tainted data, that data could potentially be exposed if not handled properly after deallocation. For example, if the memory was not cleared before being freed, remnants of the tainted data could remain in memory, leading to potential security risks if that memory is later reused.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the <code>TEE_Free</code> function takes a tainted pointer (<code>arg0</code>) as input, but it does not propagate taint or perform any operations that could lead to vulnerabilities. Its primary function is to deallocate memory. However, it is crucial to ensure that any sensitive data is properly handled before deallocation to prevent potential exposure of tainted data remnants. Overall, while <code>TEE_Free</code> itself does not introduce new taint propagation, it plays a critical role in memory management and should be used with caution in the context of tainted data.

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Function Signature**: 
  ```c
  TEE_Result TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint(void __unused *session,
                                        uint32_t command,
                                        uint32_t param_types,
                                        TEE_Param params[4])
  ```

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as inputs. Both are considered tainted from the start.

2. **Switch Statement**:
   - The function uses a switch statement to determine which command to execute based on the `command` parameter. The flow of tainted data depends on the value of `command`.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW`**:
     - Calls `create_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
     - **Taint Propagation**: Both `param_types` and `params` are passed directly to this function, maintaining their taint.
   
   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW`**:
     - Calls `read_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
     - **Taint Propagation**: Again, `param_types` and `params` are passed directly, preserving their taint.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE`**:
     - Calls `delete_object(param_types, params)`.
     - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from `param_types` and `params` is carried over to this function call.

   - **Default Case**:
     - Logs an error message using `EMSG` and returns `TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
     - **Taint Propagation**: No taint propagation occurs here since the function does not use `param_types` or `params`.

4. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `params` parameter is an array of `TEE_Param` structures. If any of these structures are modified within the called functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`), the taint may propagate through the members of these structures.
   - If any of the functions modify the contents of `params`, the taint will persist in those modified structures.

5. **Operations Propagating Taint**:
   - The direct passing of `param_types` and `params` to the respective functions propagates the taint.
   - If any of the called functions perform operations that modify the contents of `params`, those modifications will also be tainted.

6. **Implicit Flow**:
   - The control flow of the switch statement is dependent on the value of `command`. If `command` is influenced by external input, it can lead to different paths of execution, which may affect how taint is propagated.
   - If the `command` is derived from user input or other tainted sources, it can indirectly affect which functions are called and thus how taint flows through the system.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Inputs**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Function Calls**: 
  - `create_raw_object(param_types, params)` - Tainted
  - `read_raw_object(param_types, params)` - Tainted
  - `delete_object(param_types, params)` - Tainted
- **No Taint Propagation**: In the default case where the command is unsupported.
- **Data Aliases**: `params` as an array of `TEE_Param` structures, which may contain further tainted data if modified.

### Conclusion
The `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function effectively propagates taint from its parameters to the called functions. The taint remains intact unless explicitly sanitized or modified in a way that removes it. The control flow based on the `command` parameter introduces implicit flow considerations, as the command&#x27;s value can influence which functions are executed and how taint is managed.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: create_raw_object</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `create_raw_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` flows through the function, identify any new taint propagation, and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`)

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as inputs. The `params` array is tainted from the previous function.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   - The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected `exp_param_types`.
   - If they do not match, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`. This does not affect taint propagation since the function exits early without processing `params`.

3. **Extracting Object ID**:
   - `obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;`
     - The size of the first parameter&#x27;s memory reference is assigned to `obj_id_sz`. This is a direct use of tainted data.
   - `obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);`
     - Memory is allocated for `obj_id`. The allocation itself is not tainted, but it will hold tainted data.
   - `TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);`
     - The contents of `params[0].memref.buffer` (tainted) are copied into `obj_id`. This operation propagates the taint to `obj_id`.

4. **Extracting Data**:
   - `data_sz = params[1].memref.size;`
     - The size of the second parameter&#x27;s memory reference is assigned to `data_sz`, which is also tainted.
   - `data = TEE_Malloc(data_sz, 0);`
     - Memory is allocated for `data`. This allocation is not tainted, but it will hold tainted data.
   - `TEE_MemMove(data, params[1].memref.buffer, data_sz);`
     - The contents of `params[1].memref.buffer` (tainted) are copied into `data`. This operation propagates the taint to `data`.

5. **Creating Persistent Object**:
   - The function prepares to create a persistent object using `TEE_CreatePersistentObject`.
   - The parameters passed to this function include `obj_id` (tainted) and `obj_id_sz` (not tainted).
   - The `obj_data_flag` is set with various flags, which are not influenced by tainted data.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - If `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns the error code. The taint does not propagate further in this case.
   - If successful, the function proceeds to write data.

7. **Writing Object Data**:
   - `res = TEE_WriteObjectData(object, data, data_sz);`
     - The `data` variable (tainted) is passed to `TEE_WriteObjectData`. This is a critical point where tainted data reaches a sink (the persistent storage).
   - If this operation fails, an error message is logged, and the object is closed and deleted. If it succeeds, the object is closed.

8. **Memory Cleanup**:
   - `TEE_Free(obj_id);` and `TEE_Free(data);`
     - The allocated memory for `obj_id` and `data` is freed. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (from previous function)
- **Taint Propagation**:
  - `obj_id` becomes tainted when `params[0].memref.buffer` is copied into it.
  - `data` becomes tainted when `params[1].memref.buffer` is copied into it.
  - Tainted data reaches the sink when `data` is passed to `TEE_WriteObjectData`.

### Sinks Identified
- **Sink**: `TEE_WriteObjectData(object, data, data_sz);`
  - This function call writes tainted data to persistent storage, which is a critical sink in the context of security.

### Conclusion
The `create_raw_object` function effectively propagates taint from the `params` input to the `obj_id` and `data` variables. The taint reaches a critical sink when `data` is written to persistent storage via `TEE_WriteObjectData`. Proper validation and sanitization of the input parameters are essential to prevent potential security vulnerabilities associated with tainted data.</pre>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To continue the taint analysis for the `create_raw_object` function, we will focus on how tainted data affects the parameters `arg0` and `arg2` (which correspond to `params[0]` and `params[1]` respectively) and track the flow of tainted data through the function, especially in relation to data aliasing and operations that propagate taint.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (from the previous function)
  - Specifically, `params[0]` (which corresponds to `arg0`) and `params[1]` (which corresponds to `arg2`).

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as inputs. The `params` array is tainted from the previous function.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   - The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected `exp_param_types`. If they do not match, the function returns early, and no taint propagation occurs.

3. **Extracting Object ID**:
   - **Tainted Data Operations**:
     - `obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;`
       - The size of the first parameter&#x27;s memory reference is assigned to `obj_id_sz`. This is a direct use of tainted data from `params[0]`.
     - `obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);`
       - Memory is allocated for `obj_id`. This allocation itself is not tainted, but it will hold tainted data.
     - `TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);`
       - The contents of `params[0].memref.buffer` (tainted) are copied into `obj_id`. This operation propagates the taint to `obj_id`.

4. **Extracting Data**:
   - **Tainted Data Operations**:
     - `data_sz = params[1].memref.size;`
       - The size of the second parameter&#x27;s memory reference is assigned to `data_sz`, which is also tainted.
     - `data = TEE_Malloc(data_sz, 0);`
       - Memory is allocated for `data`. This allocation is not tainted, but it will hold tainted data.
     - `TEE_MemMove(data, params[1].memref.buffer, data_sz);`
       - The contents of `params[1].memref.buffer` (tainted) are copied into `data`. This operation propagates the taint to `data`.

5. **Creating Persistent Object**:
   - The function prepares to create a persistent object using `TEE_CreatePersistentObject`.
   - The parameters passed to this function include `obj_id` (tainted) and `obj_id_sz` (not tainted). The taint from `params[0]` is now in `obj_id`.

6. **Writing Object Data**:
   - **Tainted Data Operations**:
     - `res = TEE_WriteObjectData(object, data, data_sz);`
       - The `data` variable (tainted) is passed to `TEE_WriteObjectData`. This is a critical point where tainted data reaches a sink (the persistent storage).
       - The `data` variable is directly influenced by `params[1]`, which means that any taint in `params[1]` propagates to `data` and subsequently to the storage.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - If `TEE_WriteObjectData` fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns the error code. The taint does not propagate further in this case.
   - If successful, the function proceeds to close the object.

8. **Memory Cleanup**:
   - `TEE_Free(obj_id);` and `TEE_Free(data);`
     - The allocated memory for `obj_id` and `data` is freed. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Input**: `params[0]` and `params[1]` (from previous function)
- **Taint Propagation**:
  - `obj_id` becomes tainted when `params[0].memref.buffer` is copied into it.
  - `data` becomes tainted when `params[1].memref.buffer` is copied into it.
  - Tainted data reaches the sink when `data` is passed to `TEE_WriteObjectData`.

### Data Aliases
- **Data Aliases**:
  - `params[0]` and `params[1]` are directly aliased to `obj_id` and `data` respectively through the `TEE_MemMove` operations.
  - Any modifications to `params[0].memref.buffer` or `params[1].memref.buffer` will affect `obj_id` and `data`, respectively.

### Sinks Identified
- **Sink**: `TEE_WriteObjectData(object, data, data_sz);`
  - This function call writes tainted data to persistent storage, which is a critical sink in the context of security.

### Conclusion
The `create_raw_object` function effectively propagates taint from the `params` input to the `obj_id` and `data` variables. The taint reaches a critical sink when `data` is written to persistent storage via `TEE_WriteObjectData`. Proper validation and sanitization of the input parameters are essential to prevent potential security vulnerabilities associated with tainted data. The analysis highlights the importance of tracking tainted data through its flow and understanding how it can affect various parts of the system, especially when it reaches storage or other sensitive operations.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `param_types` and `params` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Function Signature**: 
  ```c
  TEE_Result TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint(void __unused *session,
                                        uint32_t command,
                                        uint32_t param_types,
                                        TEE_Param params[4])
  ```

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - `param_types` (type: `uint32_t`) is tainted.
   - `params` (type: `TEE_Param[4]`) is tainted.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function uses a `switch` statement based on the `command` parameter. The value of `command` determines which case is executed. The taint propagation will depend on the command value.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW`**:
     - Calls `create_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
     - Both `param_types` and `params` are passed directly to this function, propagating the taint.
   
   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW`**:
     - Calls `read_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
     - Again, both `param_types` and `params` are passed directly, propagating the taint.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE`**:
     - Calls `delete_object(param_types, params)`.
     - Both `param_types` and `params` are passed directly, propagating the taint.

   - **Default Case**:
     - Logs an error message using `EMSG`, but does not propagate taint since it does not call any function that uses the tainted parameters.

4. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `params` parameter is an array of `TEE_Param`, which means that each element of the array can be accessed and modified. If any of these elements are modified within the called functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`), the taint will propagate through those modifications.
   - If any of the functions modify the contents of `params`, the taint will persist in those modified elements.

5. **Operations that Propagate Taint**:
   - The direct passing of `param_types` and `params` to the respective functions in each case propagates the taint.
   - If any of the functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`) perform operations that modify the contents of `params`, those modifications will also carry the taint.

6. **Implicit Flow**:
   - The control flow of the `switch` statement creates an implicit flow based on the value of `command`. If `command` is influenced by external input, it can determine which function is called, thus indirectly affecting the flow of tainted data.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Data**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Propagation**: 
  - Taint is propagated to `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object` through direct parameter passing.
  - Any modifications to `params` within these functions will retain the taint.
- **Data Aliases**: The elements of the `params` array can be modified, which can lead to further taint propagation.
- **Control Dependencies**: The value of `command` determines which function is called, creating an implicit flow based on external input.

### Conclusion
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` effectively propagates tainted data through its control flow and parameter passing. Care should be taken in the called functions to ensure that tainted data is handled appropriately to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.</pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: delete_object</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `delete_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (specifically `params[0]`) flows through the function. We will identify any new taint propagation, and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (specifically `params[0]`)

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The `params` array is passed from the previous function (`TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`), and it is tainted. We will focus on `params[0]`, which is expected to be a memory reference containing the object ID to be deleted.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   - The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected type (`exp_param_types`). If it does not match, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`. This check does not propagate taint but ensures that the function is called with the correct parameters.

3. **Extracting Object ID Size**:
   - `obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;`
     - The size of the object ID is taken from the tainted `params[0]`. This means `obj_id_sz` is also tainted because it is derived from tainted data.

4. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);`
     - Memory is allocated for `obj_id`. The allocation itself does not propagate taint, but it prepares for the next operation.

5. **Copying Tainted Data**:
   - `TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);`
     - This operation copies the contents of the tainted buffer from `params[0].memref.buffer` into `obj_id`. 
     - **Taint Propagation**: The data in `obj_id` is now tainted because it is a direct copy of the tainted data from `params[0]`.

6. **Opening Persistent Object**:
   - `res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(...)`
     - The function attempts to open a persistent object using the tainted `obj_id` and its size `obj_id_sz`.
     - **Taint Propagation**: The call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` uses tainted data (`obj_id`), which means that the function is operating on potentially unsafe data.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - If `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns the result. The error message does not propagate taint, but it indicates that the operation was attempted with tainted data.

8. **Closing and Deleting the Object**:
   - `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(object);`
     - This function is called to close and delete the persistent object. The object handle is derived from the tainted `obj_id`, meaning that the deletion operation is also based on tainted data.

9. **Freeing Memory**:
   - `TEE_Free(obj_id);`
     - The allocated memory for `obj_id` is freed. This operation does not propagate taint but cleans up the allocated resources.

### Sinks
- **Sinks Identified**:
  - The primary sink in this function is the call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject`, which operates on tainted data (`obj_id`). If this function interacts with any external systems or resources, it could lead to security vulnerabilities if the data is not properly validated.
  - The deletion operation (`TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1`) also acts as a sink since it performs an action based on the tainted object ID.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Data**: `params[0]`, `obj_id`, `obj_id_sz`
- **Propagation**:
  - Taint is propagated from `params[0]` to `obj_id` through the `TEE_MemMove` operation.
  - The size of the object ID (`obj_id_sz`) is also tainted as it is derived from `params[0]`.
  - The calls to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` and `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1` operate on tainted data.
- **Sinks**: 
  - `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` and `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1` are sinks that utilize tainted data, which could lead to security issues if the data is not validated.

### Conclusion
The `delete_object` function effectively propagates tainted data from the `params` input through various operations, ultimately leading to actions that could affect system state or security. Care should be taken to validate the contents of `params[0]` before using it in sensitive operations to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_Free</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_Free` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `arg0` (which comes from the previous function, specifically the `obj_id` allocated in `delete_object`) flows through this function. Since the implementation of `TEE_Free` is not provided, we will make some assumptions based on typical memory management functions.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `arg0` (which corresponds to `obj_id` from the `delete_object` function)

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The `arg0` parameter is passed to `TEE_Free` as the pointer to the memory that was previously allocated for `obj_id`. This memory contains data that was copied from the tainted `params[0].memref.buffer`.

2. **Memory Deallocation**:
   - The purpose of `TEE_Free` is to deallocate memory that was previously allocated (in this case, the memory pointed to by `arg0`).
   - **Taint Propagation**: The act of freeing memory itself does not propagate taint. However, it is important to note that the data in that memory was tainted before it was freed.

3. **No New Taint Propagation**:
   - Since `TEE_Free` is a memory management function, it does not perform any operations that would propagate taint to new variables or data structures. Its primary role is to release memory back to the system.

4. **Sinks**:
   - In the context of `TEE_Free`, there are no sinks that would utilize the tainted data. The function does not interact with external systems or perform operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities based on the tainted data.
   - However, it is crucial to ensure that the memory being freed was not used in any subsequent operations after being freed, as this could lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Data**: `arg0` (which is `obj_id` from the previous function)
- **Propagation**:
  - The taint does not propagate further within `TEE_Free` since it is a memory deallocation function.
  - The tainted data is simply being released, and no new tainted data is created or modified.

### Conclusion
The `TEE_Free` function does not propagate taint nor does it introduce new taint. Its role is limited to deallocating memory that was previously allocated and potentially tainted. It is essential to ensure that any data that was tainted and is now freed is not accessed afterward, as this could lead to security issues such as use-after-free vulnerabilities. Overall, `TEE_Free` serves as a cleanup operation without further implications for taint analysis.</pre>

To analyze the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.<br><br>### Tainted Parameters<br>- **Tainted Parameters**: <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;params&gt;</code><br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> takes four parameters:<br>1. <code>session</code>: A pointer to a session (not tainted).<br>2. <code>command</code>: A command identifier (not tainted).<br>3. <code>param_types</code>: A parameter type identifier (tainted).<br>4. <code>params</code>: An array of <code>TEE_Param</code> structures (tainted).<br><br>### Control Flow Analysis<br>The function uses a <code>switch</code> statement to determine which command to execute based on the <code>command</code> parameter. The commands are:<br>- <code>TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW</code><br>- <code>TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW</code><br>- <code>TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE</code><br><br>### Data Flow Analysis<br>1. **Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> are tainted inputs to the function.<br><br>2. **Control Dependency**:<br>   - The flow of taint is dependent on the value of <code>command</code>. Each case in the switch statement will determine which function is called, and the taint will propagate based on the command executed.<br><br>3. **Explicit Data Flow**:<br>   - Each case in the switch statement calls a different function, passing the tainted parameters:<br>     - <code>create_raw_object(param_types, params)</code>: Tainted data flows into this function.<br>     - <code>read_raw_object(param_types, params)</code>: Tainted data flows into this function.<br>     - <code>delete_object(param_types, params)</code>: Tainted data flows into this function.<br><br>4. **Implicit Data Flow**:<br>   - The <code>command</code> parameter is not tainted, but it controls which function is executed. This means that the execution path is influenced by the value of <code>command</code>, which can lead to different handling of the tainted data.<br><br>### Data Aliases<br>- The <code>params</code> parameter is an array of <code>TEE_Param</code> structures. If any of these structures are modified within the called functions (<code>create_raw_object</code>, <code>read_raw_object</code>, <code>delete_object</code>), the taint will propagate to those modifications.<br>- If any of the functions modify the contents of <code>params</code>, the taint will persist in those modifications.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Propagation<br>- **Tainted Inputs**: <code>param_types</code>, <code>params</code><br>- **Tainted Outputs**: The output of the called functions (<code>create_raw_object</code>, <code>read_raw_object</code>, <code>delete_object</code>) may also be tainted depending on how they handle the tainted parameters.<br>- **Control Dependency**: The flow of taint is dependent on the <code>command</code> value, which determines which function is executed.<br>- **Data Aliases**: The <code>params</code> array can have its contents modified, which can lead to further taint propagation.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the tainted parameters <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> flow through the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function and are passed to other functions based on the command. The taint is propagated through explicit data flow (function calls) and is influenced by control dependencies (the value of <code>command</code>). Any modifications to the <code>params</code> array within the called functions will also propagate the taint.

To analyze the <code>delete_object</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>params</code> flows through the function, identify any new taint propagation, and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- **Tainted Input**: <code>params</code> (specifically, <code>params[0]</code>)<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The <code>delete_object</code> function is designed to delete a persistent object based on the parameters provided. It checks the parameter types, allocates memory for the object ID, and attempts to delete the object.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Tainted Input**:<br>   - The <code>params</code> array is passed into the function, and specifically, <code>params[0]</code> is used to extract the object ID.<br><br>2. **Parameter Type Check**:<br>   - The function first checks if <code>param_types</code> matches the expected type (<code>exp_param_types</code>). If it does not match, the function returns an error (<code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>). This check does not propagate taint but ensures that the function is called with the correct parameters.<br><br>3. **Extracting Object ID**:<br>   - <code>obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;</code><br>     - The size of the object ID is taken from the tainted <code>params[0]</code>. This means that <code>obj_id_sz</code> is now influenced by tainted data.<br>   - <code>obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);</code><br>     - Memory is allocated for <code>obj_id</code>. The allocation itself does not propagate taint, but it is important to note that <code>obj_id</code> will eventually hold tainted data.<br>   - <code>TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);</code><br>     - This line copies the contents of <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> (which is tainted) into <code>obj_id</code>. This operation propagates the taint from <code>params[0]</code> to <code>obj_id</code>.<br><br>4. **Object Deletion Logic**:<br>   - <code>res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(...)</code><br>     - The function attempts to open a persistent object using the tainted <code>obj_id</code>. If <code>obj_id</code> contains malicious or unexpected data, it could lead to security issues. The result of this operation (<code>res</code>) is influenced by the tainted data.<br>   - If the object is successfully opened, the function proceeds to delete it with <code>TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(object);</code>. The taint from <code>obj_id</code> has now reached a critical operation that could affect the system&#x27;s state.<br><br>5. **Memory Management**:<br>   - <code>TEE_Free(obj_id);</code><br>     - The allocated memory for <code>obj_id</code> is freed. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.<br><br>### Taint Propagation Summary<br>- **Tainted Input**: <code>params[0]</code> is tainted.<br>- **Taint Propagation**:<br>  - The size of the object ID (<code>obj_id_sz</code>) is derived from tainted data.<br>  - The contents of <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> are copied to <code>obj_id</code>, propagating the taint.<br>  - The tainted <code>obj_id</code> is used in a critical operation (<code>TEE_OpenPersistentObject</code>), which could lead to security vulnerabilities if the data is not validated properly.<br><br>### Sinks<br>- The function <code>TEE_OpenPersistentObject</code> is a potential sink for tainted data. If <code>obj_id</code> contains malicious data, it could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of persistent objects.<br>- The function <code>TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1</code> is also a sink, as it performs an action based on the potentially tainted object handle.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the <code>delete_object</code> function takes tainted input from <code>params</code>, propagates the taint through memory allocation and data copying, and ultimately uses the tainted data in critical operations that could affect system security. Proper validation and sanitization of the input data are essential to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

To analyze the <code>TEE_Free</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>arg0</code> (which is the pointer to the memory allocated in the previous function) flows through this function.

Its primary function is to deallocate memory. However, it is crucial to ensure that any sensitive data is properly handled before deallocation to prevent potential exposure of tainted data remnants. Overall, while <code>TEE_Free</code> itself does not introduce new taint propagation, it plays a critical role in memory management and should be used with caution in the context of tainted data.

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `param_types` and `params` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Function Signature**: 
  ```c
  TEE_Result TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint(void __unused *session,
                                        uint32_t command,
                                        uint32_t param_types,
                                        TEE_Param params[4])
  ```

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as parameters. Both are considered tainted upon entry.

2. **Switch Statement**:
   - The function uses a switch statement to determine which command to execute based on the `command` parameter. The `command` parameter is not tainted, but it controls the flow of execution.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - Each case in the switch statement calls a different function, passing the tainted parameters `param_types` and `params`.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW`**:
     ```c
     return create_raw_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - Tainted data (`param_types`, `params`) is passed to `create_raw_object`. The taint propagates to this function.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW`**:
     ```c
     return read_raw_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - Tainted data is passed to `read_raw_object`. The taint propagates to this function.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE`**:
     ```c
     return delete_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - Tainted data is passed to `delete_object`. The taint propagates to this function.

   - **Default Case**:
     ```c
     EMSG(&quot;Command ID 0x%x is not supported&quot;, command);
     return TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED;
     ```
     - The default case does not propagate taint since it does not use `param_types` or `params`.

### Data Aliases
- **Parameters**:
  - `params` is an array of `TEE_Param`, which may contain pointers or references to other data structures. If any of the `TEE_Param` elements are modified or used in a way that exposes their contents, the taint could propagate further.
  
- **Implicit Aliases**:
  - If `params` is passed to any of the called functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`), and those functions manipulate the contents of `params`, the taint will continue to propagate through those functions.

### Operations that Propagate Taint
- The direct passing of `param_types` and `params` to the functions `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object` propagates the taint.
- If any of these functions perform operations that modify the contents of `params` or use `param_types` in a way that affects the output, the taint will continue to propagate.

### Control Dependencies
- The control flow is dependent on the value of `command`. If `command` is not one of the expected values, the function will not propagate taint through the other cases, and instead, it will log an error and return a non-tainted error code.

### Summary
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Taint Propagation**: Taint propagates to `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object` based on the value of `command`.
- **Data Aliases**: `params` is an array of `TEE_Param`, which may contain further tainted data.
- **Operations**: Direct function calls propagate taint; any modifications within those functions could further propagate taint.
- **Control Dependencies**: The flow of execution is controlled by the `command` parameter, which determines whether taint is propagated or not.

This analysis highlights the importance of understanding how tainted data flows through functions and the potential for vulnerabilities if tainted data is not properly handled.</pre>

<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: delete_object</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `delete_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` flows through the function. We will identify any new taint propagation, and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (specifically, `params[0]` which is expected to be a memory reference containing the object ID)

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as parameters. The `params` array is tainted upon entry, specifically `params[0]` which is expected to contain a memory reference to the object ID.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   ```c
   if (param_types != exp_param_types)
       return TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS;
   ```
   - The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected parameter types. If it does not match, the function returns an error. This check does not propagate taint but ensures that the function only processes valid input.

3. **Extracting Object ID Size**:
   ```c
   obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;
   ```
   - The size of the object ID is extracted from `params[0].memref.size`. This variable (`obj_id_sz`) is derived from tainted data, so it is also considered tainted.

4. **Memory Allocation**:
   ```c
   obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);
   if (!obj_id)
       return TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
   ```
   - Memory is allocated for `obj_id` based on the tainted size `obj_id_sz`. If the allocation fails, the function returns an error. The pointer `obj_id` itself is not tainted, but it will hold tainted data after the next operation.

5. **Copying Tainted Data**:
   ```c
   TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);
   ```
   - The contents of `params[0].memref.buffer` (which is tainted) are copied into `obj_id`. This operation propagates the taint from `params[0]` to `obj_id`. Now, `obj_id` contains tainted data.

6. **Opening Persistent Object**:
   ```c
   res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(TEE_STORAGE_PRIVATE,
                                  obj_id, obj_id_sz,
                                  TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_READ |
                                  TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_WRITE_META,
                                  &amp;object);
   ```
   - The function attempts to open a persistent object using the tainted `obj_id` and `obj_id_sz`. If the object is successfully opened, the taint continues to propagate through the `object` handle. If the operation fails, an error is logged, and the function returns the result.

7. **Error Handling**:
   ```c
   if (res != TEE_SUCCESS) {
       EMSG(&quot;Failed to open persistent object, res=0x%08x&quot;, res);
       TEE_Free(obj_id);
       return res;
   }
   ```
   - If the object cannot be opened, an error message is logged, and the function returns without further processing. The taint does not reach any sinks in this case.

8. **Closing and Deleting the Persistent Object**:
   ```c
   TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(object);
   ```
   - If the object was successfully opened, it is then closed and deleted. The taint from `obj_id` has reached this point, as the object being deleted is based on the tainted data.

9. **Freeing Memory**:
   ```c
   TEE_Free(obj_id);
   ```
   - The allocated memory for `obj_id` is freed. This does not affect the taint flow but is important for resource management.

10. **Return Statement**:
    ```c
    return res;
    ```
    - The function returns the result of the operation. If the operation was successful, the taint has propagated through the function and reached the sink (the deletion of the object).

### Summary of Taint Flow
- **Tainted Input**: `params[0]` is tainted.
- **Taint Propagation**:
  - `obj_id_sz` is tainted (derived from `params[0].memref.size`).
  - `obj_id` becomes tainted after copying from `params[0].memref.buffer`.
  - The call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` uses tainted data (`obj_id`), propagating taint further.
- **Sinks**: 
  - The tainted data reaches a sink when the persistent object is deleted via `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(object)`. This is a critical point where potentially unsafe data is acted upon.

### Conclusion
The `delete_object` function successfully propagates tainted data from `params` through various operations, ultimately reaching a sink where the tainted data is used to delete a persistent object. Proper validation and sanitization of the input data are crucial to prevent potential vulnerabilities.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_Malloc</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_Malloc` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `arg0` (which represents the size of the memory to be allocated) flows through this function. Since the implementation of `TEE_Malloc` is not provided, we will focus on the expected behavior of a typical memory allocation function and how taint analysis would apply.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `arg0` (the size of memory to allocate, derived from `params[0].memref.size` in the previous function)

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function `TEE_Malloc` is called with `arg0` as the size parameter. This parameter is tainted because it originates from the tainted `params` in the `delete_object` function.

2. **Memory Allocation**:
   - The purpose of `TEE_Malloc` is to allocate a block of memory of size `arg0`. The taint analysis here focuses on whether the allocation process itself propagates taint or if it introduces any new taint.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - If `TEE_Malloc` uses `arg0` directly to allocate memory, the allocated memory block will be considered tainted because it was requested based on tainted input. The pointer returned by `TEE_Malloc` (let&#x27;s denote it as `ptr`) will also be tainted, as it points to a memory region that was allocated based on the tainted size.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If the allocation fails (e.g., if `arg0` is too large or if there is insufficient memory), `TEE_Malloc` typically returns a null pointer. The calling function (`delete_object`) checks for this condition:
     ```c
     if (!obj_id)
         return TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
     ```
   - In this case, the taint does not propagate further since the function returns an error code, and no further operations are performed on the tainted data.

5. **Return Value**:
   - If the allocation is successful, `TEE_Malloc` returns a pointer to the allocated memory. This pointer is tainted because it is derived from the tainted input `arg0`.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- **Tainted Input**: `arg0` (size of memory to allocate) is tainted.
- **Taint Propagation**:
  - The memory allocated by `TEE_Malloc` is tainted because it is based on the tainted size `arg0`.
  - The pointer returned by `TEE_Malloc` (let&#x27;s call it `ptr`) is also tainted.
- **Sinks**: 
  - There are no direct sinks within `TEE_Malloc` itself, as it is primarily a memory allocation function. However, if the allocated memory is subsequently used in a way that affects program behavior (e.g., writing to it, passing it to other functions), the taint will propagate further.

### Conclusion
The `TEE_Malloc` function propagates tainted data through the memory allocation process. The taint originates from the size parameter `arg0`, and if the allocation is successful, the pointer to the allocated memory is also tainted. Proper handling of the allocated memory is crucial in subsequent operations to ensure that tainted data does not lead to vulnerabilities or unintended behavior.</pre>

To analyze the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> as they flow through the function.

Both are considered tainted from the start.<br><br>2. **Switch Statement**:<br>   - The function uses a switch statement to determine which command to execute based on the <code>command</code> parameter. The <code>command</code> parameter is not tainted, but it controls the flow of execution based on the value of <code>command</code>.<br><br>3. **Case Analysis**:<br>   - Each case in the switch statement calls a different function, passing the tainted parameters <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code>.<br><br>   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW**:<br>     <pre>     return create_raw_object(param_types, params);<br>     </pre><br>     - **Tainted Data Flow**: <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> are passed directly to <code>create_raw_object</code>, maintaining their taint.<br><br>   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW**:<br>     <pre>     return read_raw_object(param_types, params);<br>     </pre><br>     - **Tainted Data Flow**: Similar to the previous case, <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> are passed to <code>read_raw_object</code>, propagating the taint.<br><br>   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE**:<br>     <pre>     return delete_object(param_types, params);<br>     </pre><br>     - **Tainted Data Flow**: Again, <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> are passed to <code>delete_object</code>, maintaining their taint.<br><br>   - **Default Case**:<br>     <pre>     EMSG(&amp;quot;Command ID 0x%x is not supported&amp;quot;, command);<br>     return TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED;<br>     </pre><br>     - In the default case, no tainted data is propagated since it does not call any function that uses <code>param_types</code> or <code>params</code>.<br><br>4. **Data Aliases**:<br>   - The <code>params</code> parameter is an array of <code>TEE_Param</code> structures. If any of the elements of this array are pointers or contain pointers, they may introduce additional data aliases. However, the analysis does not provide details on the structure of <code>TEE_Param</code>, so we cannot definitively identify aliases without that information.<br><br>5. **Operations Propagating Taint**:<br>   - The function does not perform any operations that would create new variables from the tainted parameters. The taint is propagated through function calls only.<br><br>6. **Control Dependencies**:<br>   - The control flow is dependent on the value of <code>command</code>. If <code>command</code> matches one of the defined cases, the taint is propagated. If it does not match, the function does not propagate any taint, as it only logs an error message and returns an error code.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Propagation<br>- **Tainted Inputs**: <code>param_types</code>, <code>params</code><br>- **Tainted Outputs**: The functions <code>create_raw_object</code>, <code>read_raw_object</code>, and <code>delete_object</code> are called with tainted parameters, which means they may also propagate taint further.<br>- **No New Variables**: No new variables are created that would carry taint.<br>- **Control Flow**: The taint is only propagated if the <code>command</code> matches one of the defined cases.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>The <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function effectively propagates taint from its parameters to the called functions based on the command provided. The taint remains intact through the function calls, and the control flow determines whether the taint is propagated or not. Further analysis of the called functions would be necessary to understand how the taint is handled beyond this point.

To analyze the <code>delete_object</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>params</code> (from the previous function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>) flows through this function.

To analyze the <code>TEE_Malloc</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>arg0</code> (which represents the size of the memory to be allocated, derived from the tainted <code>params</code> in the previous function) flows through this function. Since the implementation of <code>TEE_Malloc</code> is not provided, we will make assumptions based on typical memory allocation behavior.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- **Tainted Input**: <code>arg0</code> (the size of memory to allocate, which is derived from <code>params[0].memref.size</code> in the <code>delete_object</code> function)<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Function Entry**:<br>   - The function <code>TEE_Malloc</code> is called with <code>arg0</code> as the size of the memory to allocate.

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: 
  - `param_types` (uint32_t)
  - `params` (TEE_Param[4])

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes a command and based on the command value, it calls one of three functions: `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, or `delete_object`. Each of these functions receives the tainted parameters.

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - `param_types` and `params` are initially tainted when passed into the function.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of `command`.
   - The taint from `param_types` and `params` will propagate to the called functions depending on the command.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW`**:
     - Calls `create_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
     - Tainted data (`param_types`, `params`) is passed to `create_raw_object`, which means any operations within this function that use these parameters will also be tainted.
   
   - **Case `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW`**:
     - Calls `read_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
     - Similar to the previous case, the taint propagates to `read_raw_object`.
   
   - **Case `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE`**:
     - Calls `delete_object(param_types, params)`.
     - Again, the taint propagates to `delete_object`.

4. **Default Case**:
   - If the command does not match any of the cases, an error message is logged, and `TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` is returned. No taint propagation occurs here since no tainted parameters are used.

### Data Aliases
- The `params` parameter is an array of `TEE_Param`, which means that each element of this array can be accessed and modified. If any of these elements are modified within the called functions, the taint will still be present in the modified data.
- The `param_types` is a simple integer, so it does not have aliases, but it can still influence the behavior of the called functions based on its value.

### Operations that Propagate Taint
- The function calls to `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object` propagate the taint from `param_types` and `params` to these functions. Any operations within these functions that utilize these parameters will also be tainted.

### Implicit Flow
- The control flow of the `switch` statement creates an implicit flow based on the value of `command`. Depending on the command, different functions are called, and the taint is conditionally propagated based on the command&#x27;s value.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Inputs**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Tainted Outputs**: The outputs of `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object` may also be tainted depending on how they handle the tainted inputs.
- **Control Dependencies**: The taint propagation is dependent on the value of `command`, which determines which function is called.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the taint from `param_types` and `params` propagates through the function to the respective command handling functions. The analysis shows that the taint is preserved and can affect the security of the operations performed by the Trusted Application. Proper handling and validation of these parameters in the called functions are crucial to maintaining the integrity and security of the application.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: delete_object</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `delete_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (from the previous function)

### Function Overview
The `delete_object` function is responsible for deleting a persistent object based on the parameters provided. It checks the parameter types, allocates memory for the object ID, and performs operations to delete the object.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The `params` array is passed into the function, and it is tainted from the previous function.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   - The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected `exp_param_types`. If it does not match, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`, and no further processing occurs. This check does not propagate taint but prevents further execution if the parameters are invalid.

3. **Extracting Object ID Size**:
   - `obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;`
     - The size of the object ID is taken from the first element of the `params` array. This variable (`obj_id_sz`) is now derived from tainted data, so it is also tainted.

4. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);`
     - Memory is allocated for `obj_id` based on the tainted size. If the allocation fails, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`. The allocation itself does not propagate taint, but the subsequent operations will use the tainted data.

5. **Copying Object ID**:
   - `TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);`
     - The contents of `params[0].memref.buffer` are copied into `obj_id`. Since `params[0].memref.buffer` is tainted, the data in `obj_id` is also tainted after this operation. This is a direct propagation of taint.

6. **Opening Persistent Object**:
   - `res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(...)`
     - The function attempts to open a persistent object using the tainted `obj_id` and its size (`obj_id_sz`). If the object exists, the operation will proceed; if not, an error is logged, and the function returns the result. The result (`res`) may be influenced by the tainted data, as it determines whether the object can be accessed.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - If `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` fails, an error message is logged, and `TEE_Free(obj_id)` is called to free the allocated memory. The taint does not propagate further in this case, as the function exits early.

8. **Closing and Deleting the Object**:
   - `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(object);`
     - If the object is successfully opened, it is then closed and deleted. This operation does not introduce new taint but operates on the object handle that was derived from the tainted `obj_id`.

9. **Freeing Memory**:
   - `TEE_Free(obj_id);`
     - The allocated memory for `obj_id` is freed. This operation does not propagate taint but cleans up the resources.

### Taint Propagation Summary
- **Tainted Inputs**: `params` (specifically `params[0].memref.buffer` and `params[0].memref.size`)
- **New Taint Propagation**:
  - `obj_id_sz` is tainted from `params[0].memref.size`.
  - `obj_id` is tainted from `params[0].memref.buffer` after the `TEE_MemMove` operation.
- **Sinks**:
  - The tainted data reaches the `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` function, which is a potential sink. If this function uses the tainted `obj_id` in a way that affects security (e.g., accessing or modifying sensitive data), it could lead to vulnerabilities.
  - The function also logs an error message if the object cannot be opened, which could expose information about the tainted data if not handled properly.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the taint from `params` propagates through the `delete_object` function, particularly through the extraction of the object ID size and the copying of the object ID. The function interacts with a potential sink (`TEE_OpenPersistentObject`), which could lead to security implications if the tainted data is not properly validated or sanitized. Proper handling of the tainted data is essential to ensure the security of the Trusted Application.</pre>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To continue the taint analysis, we will focus on how tainted data could affect the parameters `arg0` and `arg2` in the context of the `delete_object` function. We will track the flow of tainted data through the function, paying special attention to data aliases and operations that propagate taint.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (specifically `params[0].memref.buffer` and `params[0].memref.size`)

### Function Overview
The `delete_object` function processes the `params` array to delete a persistent object. We will analyze how tainted data from `params` could affect the parameters `arg0` and `arg2`, which are not explicitly defined in the provided code but are assumed to be relevant in the context of the function&#x27;s operations.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The `params` array is passed into the function, and it is tainted from the previous function. Specifically, `params[0].memref.buffer` and `params[0].memref.size` are tainted.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   - The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected `exp_param_types`. If it does not match, the function returns early, and no taint propagation occurs.

3. **Extracting Object ID Size**:
   - `obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;`
     - The size of the object ID is derived from the tainted `params[0].memref.size`. This means `obj_id_sz` is tainted.

4. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);`
     - Memory is allocated for `obj_id` based on the tainted size. If the allocation fails, the function returns an error. The allocation itself does not propagate taint, but the subsequent operations will use the tainted data.

5. **Copying Object ID**:
   - `TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);`
     - This operation copies the contents of the tainted `params[0].memref.buffer` into `obj_id`. After this operation, `obj_id` contains tainted data. 

### Tracking Tainted Data to `arg0` and `arg2`

Assuming `arg0` and `arg2` are parameters that are affected by the operations in `delete_object`, we will analyze how tainted data could reach them:

- **Potential Tainted Data Flow to `arg0`**:
  - If `arg0` is intended to be used in conjunction with the `obj_id` (for example, if `arg0` is used in a function that requires the object ID), then `arg0` could be tainted through the use of `obj_id`.
  - For instance, if there is a subsequent function call that uses `obj_id` as an argument (e.g., `TEE_OpenPersistentObject`), and if `arg0` is derived from or directly assigned the value of `obj_id`, then `arg0` would also be tainted.

- **Potential Tainted Data Flow to `arg2`**:
  - Similarly, if `arg2` is used in a context where it receives data from `obj_id` or is influenced by the operations involving `params`, it could also be tainted.
  - For example, if `arg2` is assigned the value of `obj_id` or is used in a function that processes `obj_id`, then it would inherit the taint from the original `params`.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Inputs**: `params[0].memref.buffer`, `params[0].memref.size`
- **New Taint Propagation**:
  - `obj_id_sz` is tainted from `params[0].memref.size`.
  - `obj_id` is tainted from `params[0].memref.buffer` after the `TEE_MemMove` operation.
- **Potential Tainted Outputs**:
  - If `arg0` or `arg2` are assigned or derived from `obj_id`, they will also be tainted.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the taint from `params` propagates through the `delete_object` function, particularly through the extraction of the object ID size and the copying of the object ID. If `arg0` and `arg2` are influenced by `obj_id` or the operations involving `params`, they could also become tainted. It is crucial to ensure that any data derived from tainted sources is properly validated and sanitized before use to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. Proper handling of tainted data is essential to maintain the integrity and security of the Trusted Application.</pre>

To analyze the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.<br><br>### Tainted Parameters<br>- **Tainted Parameters**: <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;params&gt;</code><br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> takes four parameters:<br>1. <code>session</code>: Unused in this analysis.<br>2. <code>command</code>: A command identifier.<br>3. <code>param_types</code>: Tainted parameter.<br>4. <code>params</code>: Tainted parameter (array of <code>TEE_Param</code>).<br><br>### Control Flow Analysis<br>The function uses a switch statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of <code>command</code>. The commands correspond to different operations that utilize the tainted parameters.<br><br>### Taint Data Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> are initially tainted.<br><br>2. **Switch Statement**:<br>   - The <code>command</code> variable is not tainted, but it controls which case is executed. The flow of taint depends on the value of <code>command</code>.<br><br>3. **Case Analysis**:<br>   - **Case <code>TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>create_raw_object(param_types, params)</code>.<br>     - **Taint Propagation**: Both <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> are passed to this function, propagating the taint.<br>   <br>   - **Case <code>TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>read_raw_object(param_types, params)</code>.<br>     - **Taint Propagation**: Again, both <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> are passed, propagating the taint.<br>   <br>   - **Case <code>TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>delete_object(param_types, params)</code>.<br>     - **Taint Propagation**: Both parameters are passed, propagating the taint.<br><br>4. **Default Case**:<br>   - If <code>command</code> does not match any of the specified cases, it logs an error message and returns <code>TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED</code>.<br>   - **Taint Propagation**: No taint propagation occurs here since no tainted parameters are used.<br><br>### Data Aliases<br>- The <code>params</code> parameter is an array of <code>TEE_Param</code>, which may contain pointers or references to other data structures. If any of the elements in <code>params</code> are modified within the called functions (<code>create_raw_object</code>, <code>read_raw_object</code>, <code>delete_object</code>), the taint may propagate further through those modifications.<br><br>### Operations Propagating Taint<br>- The function does not perform any direct assignments or modifications to the tainted parameters. However, the calls to the other functions (<code>create_raw_object</code>, <code>read_raw_object</code>, <code>delete_object</code>) are critical as they may manipulate the tainted data.<br><br>### Implicit Flow<br>- The control flow through the switch statement is dependent on the value of <code>command</code>. If <code>command</code> is influenced by external input, it can lead to different paths of execution, which may affect how taint is propagated based on which function is called.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- **Tainted Parameters**: <code>param_types</code>, <code>params</code><br>- **Flow**:<br>  - Tainted parameters are passed to the respective command functions based on the value of <code>command</code>.<br>  - Taint is propagated to the called functions, which may further manipulate the data.<br>- **No direct modifications** to the tainted parameters within <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>.<br>- **Control dependencies**: The flow of execution is dependent on the value of <code>command</code>, which can affect which tainted data is processed.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>The <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function effectively propagates tainted data through its command handling mechanism, relying on external functions to process the tainted parameters. Care should be taken in those functions to ensure that taint is managed appropriately.

To continue the taint analysis based on the previous results, we will focus on how tainted data can affect multiple parameters, specifically <code>arg0</code> and <code>arg2</code>, in the context of the <code>delete_object</code> function.

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Function Signature**: 
  ```c
  TEE_Result TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint(void __unused *session,
                                        uint32_t command,
                                        uint32_t param_types,
                                        TEE_Param params[4])
  ```

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as inputs. Both are considered tainted from the start.

2. **Switch Statement**:
   - The function uses a switch statement to determine which command to execute based on the `command` parameter. The `command` parameter is not tainted, but it controls the flow of execution based on the value of `command`.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - Each case in the switch statement calls a different function, passing the tainted parameters `param_types` and `params`.

   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW**:
     ```c
     return create_raw_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - **Tainted Data Flow**: `param_types` and `params` are passed directly to `create_raw_object`, maintaining their taint.

   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW**:
     ```c
     return read_raw_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - **Tainted Data Flow**: Similar to the previous case, `param_types` and `params` are passed to `read_raw_object`, propagating the taint.

   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE**:
     ```c
     return delete_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - **Tainted Data Flow**: Again, `param_types` and `params` are passed to `delete_object`, maintaining their taint.

   - **Default Case**:
     ```c
     EMSG(&quot;Command ID 0x%x is not supported&quot;, command);
     return TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED;
     ```
     - In the default case, no tainted data is propagated since it does not call any function that uses `param_types` or `params`.

4. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `params` parameter is an array of `TEE_Param` structures. If any of the elements of this array are pointers or contain pointers, they may introduce additional data aliases. However, the analysis does not provide details on the structure of `TEE_Param`, so we cannot definitively identify aliases without that information.

5. **Operations Propagating Taint**:
   - The function does not perform any operations that would create new variables from the tainted parameters. The taint is propagated through function calls only.

6. **Control Dependencies**:
   - The control flow is dependent on the value of `command`. If `command` matches one of the defined cases, the taint is propagated. If it does not match, the function does not propagate any taint, as it only logs an error message and returns an error code.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Inputs**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Tainted Outputs**: The functions `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object` are called with tainted parameters, which means they may also propagate taint further.
- **No New Variables**: No new variables are created that would carry taint.
- **Control Flow**: The taint is only propagated if the `command` matches one of the defined cases.

### Conclusion
The `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function effectively propagates taint from its parameters to the called functions based on the command provided. The taint remains intact through the function calls, and the control flow determines whether the taint is propagated or not. Further analysis of the called functions would be necessary to understand how the taint is handled beyond this point.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: delete_object</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `delete_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (specifically, `params[0]` which is expected to be a memory reference containing the object ID)

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as inputs. The `params` array is tainted, specifically `params[0]` which is expected to contain a memory reference to the object ID.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   ```c
   if (param_types != exp_param_types)
       return TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS;
   ```
   - The function checks if the `param_types` matches the expected type. If it does not match, the function returns an error without propagating any taint. If it matches, the function continues, and the taint remains intact.

3. **Extracting Object ID Size**:
   ```c
   obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;
   ```
   - The size of the object ID is extracted from the tainted `params[0]`. This operation does not create new taint but uses the existing taint from `params`.

4. **Memory Allocation**:
   ```c
   obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);
   if (!obj_id)
       return TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
   ```
   - Memory is allocated for `obj_id`. The allocation itself does not propagate taint, but `obj_id` will hold the tainted data once it is copied.

5. **Copying Tainted Data**:
   ```c
   TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);
   ```
   - The contents of `params[0].memref.buffer` (which is tainted) are copied into `obj_id`. This operation propagates the taint from `params[0]` to `obj_id`. Now, `obj_id` is tainted.

6. **Opening Persistent Object**:
   ```c
   res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(TEE_STORAGE_PRIVATE,
                                  obj_id, obj_id_sz,
                                  TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_READ |
                                  TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_WRITE_META,
                                  &amp;object);
   ```
   - The function attempts to open a persistent object using the tainted `obj_id`. If `obj_id` contains sensitive or untrusted data, this could lead to security issues. The result of this operation (`res`) is not tainted, but it is dependent on the tainted `obj_id`.

7. **Error Handling**:
   ```c
   if (res != TEE_SUCCESS) {
       EMSG(&quot;Failed to open persistent object, res=0x%08x&quot;, res);
       TEE_Free(obj_id);
       return res;
   }
   ```
   - If the object cannot be opened, an error message is logged, and the function returns without further taint propagation.

8. **Closing and Deleting the Persistent Object**:
   ```c
   TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(object);
   ```
   - This operation does not involve tainted data directly, but it acts on the object that was opened using the tainted `obj_id`.

9. **Freeing Allocated Memory**:
   ```c
   TEE_Free(obj_id);
   ```
   - The allocated memory for `obj_id` is freed. This does not propagate taint but cleans up the tainted data.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Input**: `params[0]` (specifically, `params[0].memref.buffer`)
- **Tainted Output**: 
  - `obj_id` becomes tainted after copying from `params[0].memref.buffer`.
  - The taint is propagated to the call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject`, which uses the tainted `obj_id`.
- **Sinks**: 
  - The function `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` is a potential sink as it operates on the tainted data (`obj_id`). If this function uses the object ID in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities (e.g., accessing or modifying sensitive data), it represents a risk.
  
### Conclusion
The `delete_object` function effectively propagates taint from the `params` input to the `obj_id` variable, which is then used in a critical operation that could lead to security issues if the tainted data is not properly validated. The function does not create new tainted variables but does pass tainted data to a sink, which should be carefully monitored for security implications. Further analysis of `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` would be necessary to understand how it handles the tainted data.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_Malloc</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_Malloc` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `arg0` (which represents the size of the memory to be allocated, derived from the tainted `params` in the previous function) flows through this function. Since the implementation of `TEE_Malloc` is not provided, we will make assumptions based on typical memory allocation behavior.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `arg0` (the size of memory to allocate, which is derived from `params[0].memref.size` in the `delete_object` function)

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function `TEE_Malloc` is called with `arg0` as the size of the memory to allocate. This size is derived from the tainted `params[0]`, which means `arg0` is also tainted.

2. **Memory Allocation**:
   - The purpose of `TEE_Malloc` is to allocate a block of memory of size `arg0`. The taint analysis here focuses on whether the allocation process itself propagates taint or if it introduces any new variables that could carry taint.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The return value of `TEE_Malloc` is a pointer to the allocated memory. If the allocation is successful, this pointer can be considered tainted because it is associated with the size that was derived from tainted data. If the allocation fails, the function typically returns `NULL`, which does not carry taint.

### Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Input**: `arg0` (size of memory to allocate)
- **Tainted Output**: 
  - The pointer returned by `TEE_Malloc` (let&#x27;s denote it as `ptr`) is tainted because it is allocated based on the tainted size `arg0`. This pointer will hold the allocated memory, which may later be used to store tainted data.

### Sinks
- **Potential Sinks**: 
  - The tainted pointer returned by `TEE_Malloc` can be considered a sink if it is used in subsequent operations that involve reading from or writing to the allocated memory. For example, if the allocated memory is later populated with data from a tainted source or used in a sensitive operation, it could lead to security vulnerabilities.

### Summary
- **Tainted Input**: `arg0` (size of memory to allocate)
- **Tainted Output**: The pointer returned by `TEE_Malloc` is tainted because it is based on the tainted size.
- **Sinks**: The tainted pointer can lead to potential sinks in subsequent operations that manipulate the allocated memory.

### Conclusion
The `TEE_Malloc` function propagates taint from the input size `arg0` to the pointer it returns. While the function itself does not perform any operations on the data, the tainted pointer it returns can be used in later operations that may involve sensitive data handling. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that any data written to or read from this allocated memory is properly validated to prevent security issues. Further analysis of how this pointer is used in subsequent functions would be necessary to fully understand the implications of the taint propagation.</pre>

If the allocation is successful, this pointer can be considered tainted because it is associated with the size that was derived from tainted data. If the allocation fails, the function typically returns <code>NULL</code>, which does not carry taint.<br><br>### Taint Propagation<br>- **Tainted Input**: <code>arg0</code> (size of memory to allocate)<br>- **Tainted Output**: <br>  - The pointer returned by <code>TEE_Malloc</code> (let&#x27;s denote it as <code>ptr</code>) is tainted because it is allocated based on the tainted size <code>arg0</code>. This pointer will hold the allocated memory, which may later be used to store tainted data.<br><br>### Sinks<br>- **Potential Sinks**: <br>  - The tainted pointer returned by <code>TEE_Malloc</code> can be considered a sink if it is used in subsequent operations that involve reading from or writing to the allocated memory. For example, if the allocated memory is later populated with data from a tainted source or used in a sensitive operation, it could lead to security vulnerabilities.<br><br>### Summary<br>- **Tainted Input**: <code>arg0</code> (size of memory to allocate)<br>- **Tainted Output**: The pointer returned by <code>TEE_Malloc</code> is tainted because it is based on the tainted size.<br>- **Sinks**: The tainted pointer can lead to potential sinks in subsequent operations that manipulate the allocated memory.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>The <code>TEE_Malloc</code> function propagates taint from the input size <code>arg0</code> to the pointer it returns. While the function itself does not perform any operations on the data, the tainted pointer it returns can be used in later operations that may involve sensitive data handling. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that any data written to or read from this allocated memory is properly validated to prevent security issues. Further analysis of how this pointer is used in subsequent functions would be necessary to fully understand the implications of the taint propagation.

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `param_types` and `params` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Function Signature**: 
  ```c
  TEE_Result TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint(void __unused *session,
                                        uint32_t command,
                                        uint32_t param_types,
                                        TEE_Param params[4])
  ```

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as parameters. Both are considered tainted upon entry.

2. **Switch Statement**:
   - The function uses a switch statement to determine which command to execute based on the `command` parameter. The `command` parameter is not tainted, but it controls the flow of execution.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - Each case in the switch statement calls a different function, passing the tainted parameters `param_types` and `params`.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW`**:
     ```c
     return create_raw_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - **Tainted Data Flow**: `param_types` and `params` are passed directly to `create_raw_object`. The taint propagates to this function.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW`**:
     ```c
     return read_raw_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - **Tainted Data Flow**: Similar to the previous case, `param_types` and `params` are passed to `read_raw_object`, propagating the taint.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE`**:
     ```c
     return delete_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - **Tainted Data Flow**: Again, `param_types` and `params` are passed to `delete_object`, propagating the taint.

   - **Default Case**:
     ```c
     EMSG(&quot;Command ID 0x%x is not supported&quot;, command);
     return TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED;
     ```
     - The default case does not propagate any taint since it does not use `param_types` or `params`.

4. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `params` parameter is an array of `TEE_Param` structures. If any of the functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`) manipulate the contents of `params`, the taint may propagate through the members of the `TEE_Param` structure.
   - If any of these functions modify the contents of `params`, the taint will persist in the modified data.

5. **Operations Propagating Taint**:
   - The direct passing of `param_types` and `params` to the respective functions propagates the taint.
   - If any of the called functions perform operations that modify the contents of `params`, the taint will continue to propagate through those modifications.

6. **Implicit Data Flow**:
   - The control flow of the switch statement is dependent on the value of `command`. If `command` is influenced by user input or external data, it can lead to different execution paths that may or may not propagate taint based on the case executed.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params` are tainted upon entry.
- **Taint Propagation**: 
  - Taint is propagated to `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object` through direct parameter passing.
  - If any of these functions modify `params`, the taint persists in the modified data.
- **Data Aliases**: `params` is an array of `TEE_Param`, which may have internal members that can also be tainted if modified.
- **Control Dependencies**: The execution path is determined by the `command` parameter, which can affect whether taint is propagated based on which case is executed.

This analysis highlights the importance of tracking tainted data through function calls and understanding how control flow can affect data security in Trusted Applications.</pre>

<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: delete_object</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `delete_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` flows through the function, identify any new taint propagation, and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (specifically, `params[0]` which is expected to be a memory reference containing the object ID).

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as parameters. The `params` array is tainted from the previous function (`TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`).

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   ```c
   if (param_types != exp_param_types)
       return TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS;
   ```
   - The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected type. If it does not, the function returns an error. This check does not affect taint propagation.

3. **Extracting Object ID Size**:
   ```c
   obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;
   ```
   - The size of the object ID is extracted from `params[0].memref.size`. Since `params` is tainted, `obj_id_sz` is also considered tainted because it directly derives from tainted data.

4. **Memory Allocation**:
   ```c
   obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);
   if (!obj_id)
       return TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
   ```
   - Memory is allocated for `obj_id` based on the tainted size `obj_id_sz`. If the allocation fails, the function returns an error. The allocation itself does not propagate taint, but it is important to note that `obj_id` will hold tainted data if the subsequent operations succeed.

5. **Copying Tainted Data**:
   ```c
   TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);
   ```
   - The function copies data from `params[0].memref.buffer` to `obj_id`. Since `params` is tainted, the data being copied is also tainted. Therefore, `obj_id` now contains tainted data.

6. **Opening Persistent Object**:
   ```c
   res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(TEE_STORAGE_PRIVATE,
                                  obj_id, obj_id_sz,
                                  TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_READ |
                                  TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_WRITE_META,
                                  &amp;object);
   ```
   - The function attempts to open a persistent object using the tainted `obj_id` and `obj_id_sz`. If the object ID is derived from user input, this could lead to security issues if the input is not properly validated. The result of this operation (`res`) is not tainted, but it is influenced by the tainted `obj_id`.

7. **Error Handling**:
   ```c
   if (res != TEE_SUCCESS) {
       EMSG(&quot;Failed to open persistent object, res=0x%08x&quot;, res);
       TEE_Free(obj_id);
       return res;
   }
   ```
   - If the object cannot be opened, an error message is logged, and the function returns. The error message does not propagate taint, but it indicates that the operation failed due to the tainted input.

8. **Closing and Deleting the Persistent Object**:
   ```c
   TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(object);
   ```
   - This operation does not involve tainted data directly, but it acts on the object that was opened using the tainted `obj_id`.

9. **Freeing Memory**:
   ```c
   TEE_Free(obj_id);
   ```
   - The allocated memory for `obj_id` is freed. This operation does not propagate taint but is important for resource management.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Input**: `params` is tainted upon entry.
- **Taint Propagation**:
  - `obj_id_sz` is tainted as it is derived from `params[0].memref.size`.
  - `obj_id` becomes tainted when data is copied from `params[0].memref.buffer`.
  - The call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` uses tainted data (`obj_id`), which could lead to security vulnerabilities if the input is not validated.
  
- **Sinks**:
  - The function does not directly expose any sinks that would leak tainted data to an external entity. However, the use of tainted data in `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` could lead to security issues if the object ID is manipulated or controlled by an attacker.

### Conclusion
The `delete_object` function propagates taint from the `params` input through the extraction of the object ID size and the copying of the object ID itself. The function&#x27;s reliance on this tainted data for critical operations (like opening a persistent object) highlights the importance of validating and sanitizing input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.</pre>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_Free` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `arg0` (which is the pointer to the memory allocated for `obj_id` in the previous function) flows through this function. Since the implementation of `TEE_Free` is not provided, we will make some assumptions based on typical memory management functions.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `arg0` (the pointer to the memory allocated for `obj_id`).

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function `TEE_Free` is called with `arg0`, which is a pointer to the memory that was allocated in the `delete_object` function. This memory contains tainted data (the object ID).

2. **Memory Deallocation**:
   - The purpose of `TEE_Free` is to deallocate memory that was previously allocated (in this case, the memory pointed to by `arg0`).
   - Since `TEE_Free` is a memory management function, it typically does not perform any operations on the data contained in the memory being freed. Instead, it simply marks that memory as available for future allocations.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The taint does not propagate further through `TEE_Free` because the function is designed to free memory rather than manipulate or expose the data within that memory.
   - However, it is important to note that the data in the memory being freed (the object ID) was tainted when it was allocated and copied from `params[0].memref.buffer`. Once `TEE_Free` is called, the memory is no longer accessible, and thus the taint cannot propagate beyond this point.

4. **Sinks**:
   - Since `TEE_Free` is a memory management function, it does not expose any sinks that would leak tainted data to an external entity. The function&#x27;s role is to manage memory, and it does not return or output any data.
   - The tainted data (the object ID) is effectively discarded when the memory is freed, meaning it cannot reach any sinks after this point.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Input**: `arg0` is tainted upon entry, as it points to memory that contains tainted data (the object ID).
- **Taint Propagation**: 
  - No new taint is propagated through `TEE_Free`, as the function does not manipulate the data within the memory being freed.
  - The taint is effectively removed when the memory is deallocated, as the data is no longer accessible.

- **Sinks**: 
  - There are no sinks in `TEE_Free` that would expose or leak tainted data. The function&#x27;s purpose is solely to free memory.

### Conclusion
The `TEE_Free` function does not propagate taint beyond its entry point, as it is designed to deallocate memory without manipulating the data contained within that memory. The tainted data (the object ID) is effectively discarded when the memory is freed, preventing any further exposure or leakage of tainted information.</pre>

If <code>obj_id</code> contains malicious data, it could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of persistent objects.<br>- The function <code>TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1</code> is also a sink, as it performs an action based on the potentially tainted object handle.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the <code>delete_object</code> function takes tainted input from <code>params</code>, propagates the taint through memory allocation and data copying, and ultimately uses the tainted data in critical operations that could affect system security. Proper validation and sanitization of the input data are essential to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

To analyze the <code>TEE_Free</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>arg0</code> (which is the pointer to the memory allocated in the previous function) flows through this function. Since the implementation of <code>TEE_Free</code> is not provided, we will focus on the conceptual aspects of taint propagation and potential sinks.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- **Tainted Input**: <code>arg0</code> (the pointer to the memory allocated for <code>obj_id</code> in the <code>delete_object</code> function)<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The <code>TEE_Free</code> function is typically used to deallocate memory that was previously allocated. In this context, it is called to free the memory pointed to by <code>obj_id</code>, which contains potentially tainted data.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Tainted Input**:<br>   - The input to <code>TEE_Free</code> is <code>arg0</code>, which is a pointer to the memory that was allocated and populated with tainted data from <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> in the <code>delete_object</code> function.<br><br>2. **Memory Deallocation**:<br>   - The primary purpose of <code>TEE_Free</code> is to release the memory allocated for <code>obj_id</code>. The function itself does not process or manipulate the contents of the memory; it simply frees the allocated block.<br>   - Since <code>TEE_Free</code> does not perform any operations on the data itself, there is no new taint propagation within this function. The taint does not change or propagate further; it simply exists in the memory that is being freed.<br><br>3. **Sinks**:<br>   - The <code>TEE_Free</code> function is not a sink in the traditional sense of data flow analysis, as it does not perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities or data leakage. Its role is limited to memory management.<br>   - However, it is important to note that if the memory being freed contained sensitive or tainted data, that data could potentially be exposed if not handled properly after deallocation. For example, if the memory was not cleared before being freed, remnants of the tainted data could remain in memory, leading to potential security risks if that memory is later reused.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the <code>TEE_Free</code> function takes a tainted pointer (<code>arg0</code>) as input, but it does not propagate taint or perform any operations that could lead to vulnerabilities. Its primary function is to deallocate memory. However, it is crucial to ensure that any sensitive data is properly handled before deallocation to prevent potential exposure of tainted data remnants. Overall, while <code>TEE_Free</code> itself does not introduce new taint propagation, it plays a critical role in memory management and should be used with caution in the context of tainted data.

<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Function Signature**: 
  ```c
  TEE_Result TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint(void __unused *session,
                                        uint32_t command,
                                        uint32_t param_types,
                                        TEE_Param params[4])
  ```

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as inputs. Both are considered tainted from the start.

2. **Switch Statement**:
   - The function uses a switch statement to determine which command to execute based on the `command` parameter. The `command` parameter is not tainted, but it controls the flow of execution based on the value it holds.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - Each case in the switch statement calls a different function, passing the tainted parameters `param_types` and `params`.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW`**:
     ```c
     return create_raw_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from `param_types` and `params` is propagated to the `create_raw_object` function. If `create_raw_object` uses these parameters, it will also be tainted.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW`**:
     ```c
     return read_raw_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - **Taint Propagation**: Similar to the previous case, the taint from `param_types` and `params` is propagated to `read_raw_object`.

   - **Case: `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE`**:
     ```c
     return delete_object(param_types, params);
     ```
     - **Taint Propagation**: Again, the taint from `param_types` and `params` is propagated to `delete_object`.

4. **Default Case**:
   ```c
   EMSG(&quot;Command ID 0x%x is not supported&quot;, command);
   return TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED;
   ```
   - In the default case, there is no propagation of taint since it does not call any function that uses the tainted parameters. The message logged does not use `param_types` or `params`, so no taint is propagated here.

### Data Aliases
- **Data Aliases**: 
  - The `params` parameter is an array of `TEE_Param` structures. If any of these structures are modified within the called functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`), the taint will persist in those structures.
  - If any of the functions modify the contents of `params`, the taint will propagate through those modifications.

### Operations that Propagate Taint
- The calls to `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object` propagate the taint from `param_types` and `params` to their respective internal operations. If these functions perform any operations that utilize the tainted data, the taint will continue to propagate.

### Implicit Flow
- The control flow of the switch statement is dependent on the value of `command`. If `command` is influenced by user input or external data, it can lead to different paths of execution, which may or may not propagate taint based on the case executed.

### Summary
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Taint Propagation**: Taint is propagated to `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object`.
- **Data Aliases**: `params` is an array of `TEE_Param`, which may contain further tainted data if modified.
- **Control Dependencies**: The flow of execution is determined by the `command` parameter, which can lead to different functions being called based on its value.

In conclusion, the taint analysis shows that the function effectively propagates tainted data through its calls to other functions, and care should be taken in those functions to handle the tainted data appropriately.</pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: read_raw_object</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `read_raw_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` flows through the function, identify any new taint propagation, and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`)

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `param_types` and `params` as inputs. The `params` array is tainted from the previous function.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   ```c
   if (param_types != exp_param_types)
       return TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS;
   ```
   - This check ensures that the `param_types` match the expected types. If they do not match, the function returns an error without propagating any taint.

3. **Extracting Object ID**:
   ```c
   obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;
   obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);
   if (!obj_id)
       return TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY;

   TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);
   ```
   - The size of the object ID is taken from `params[0].memref.size`, which is tainted.
   - Memory is allocated for `obj_id`, and then `TEE_MemMove` copies the data from `params[0].memref.buffer` to `obj_id`. 
   - **Taint Propagation**: The data copied to `obj_id` is tainted because it originates from `params`.

4. **Extracting Data Size**:
   ```c
   data_sz = params[1].memref.size;
   data = TEE_Malloc(data_sz, 0);
   if (!data)
       return TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
   ```
   - The size for the data buffer is taken from `params[1].memref.size`, which is also tainted.
   - Memory is allocated for `data`, and if successful, it will be used to store the read data.

5. **Opening Persistent Object**:
   ```c
   res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(TEE_STORAGE_PRIVATE,
                                  obj_id, obj_id_sz,
                                  TEE_DATA_FLAG_ACCESS_READ |
                                  TEE_DATA_FLAG_SHARE_READ,
                                  &amp;object);
   ```
   - The `obj_id` (tainted) is used to open a persistent object. If the object is successfully opened, the `object` handle is created.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The operation depends on the tainted `obj_id`, but it does not directly propagate taint to new variables.

6. **Getting Object Info**:
   ```c
   res = TEE_GetObjectInfo1(object, &amp;object_info);
   ```
   - This function retrieves information about the object. The result does not propagate taint but is dependent on the tainted `obj_id`.

7. **Buffer Size Check**:
   ```c
   if (object_info.dataSize &gt; data_sz) {
       params[1].memref.size = object_info.dataSize;
       res = TEE_ERROR_SHORT_BUFFER;
       goto exit;
   }
   ```
   - If the size of the data to be read exceeds the allocated size, the function updates `params[1].memref.size` with the expected size. 
   - **Taint Propagation**: The update to `params[1].memref.size` is a direct modification of tainted data.

8. **Reading Object Data**:
   ```c
   res = TEE_ReadObjectData(object, data, object_info.dataSize, &amp;read_bytes);
   ```
   - The function reads data from the object into the `data` buffer. The `data` buffer is tainted because it was allocated based on the tainted `params[1].memref.size`.

9. **Copying Read Data to Output**:
   ```c
   if (res == TEE_SUCCESS)
       TEE_MemMove(params[1].memref.buffer, data, read_bytes);
   ```
   - If the read operation is successful, the data is copied from the `data` buffer to `params[1].memref.buffer`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The data copied to `params[1].memref.buffer` is tainted because it originates from the `data` buffer, which was filled based on the tainted input.

10. **Final Size Update**:
    ```c
    params[1].memref.size = read_bytes;
    ```
    - The size of the data in `params[1].memref.size` is updated again, which is tainted.

### Sinks
- **Sinks**: 
  - The function modifies `params[1].memref.buffer`, which is a sink for tainted data. If this buffer is used later in the program without proper validation, it could lead to security vulnerabilities.
  - The function also logs error messages using `EMSG`, but these do not directly use tainted data.

### Summary
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (specifically `params[0]` and `params[1]`)
- **Taint Propagation**: 
  - Taint is propagated to `obj_id` and `data` through memory operations.
  - Tainted data is written back to `params[1].memref.buffer`, which is a sink.
- **Sinks**: The function modifies `params[1].memref.buffer`, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

In conclusion, the `read_raw_object` function effectively propagates tainted data from its input parameters to its output, particularly through the `params` structure, which should be carefully managed to avoid security issues.</pre>

<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_GetObjectInfo1</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Since the implementation of the `TEE_GetObjectInfo1` function is unavailable, we will perform a taint analysis based on the function signature and its expected behavior. We will track how the tainted input flows through this function, note any new taint propagation, and identify if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `arg0` (which corresponds to the `object` handle passed from the previous function `read_raw_object`)

### Function Signature
```c
TEE_Result TEE_GetObjectInfo1(TEE_ObjectHandle object, TEE_ObjectInfo *object_info);
```

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function receives `object`, which is a handle to a persistent object. The taint analysis assumes that the `object` handle is derived from a tainted source (i.e., it was opened based on the tainted `obj_id` in the `read_raw_object` function).

2. **Tainted Input**:
   - The `object` handle is tainted because it was obtained from a previous operation that used tainted data. The `object_info` pointer is expected to be filled with information about the object.

3. **Internal Operations**:
   - Although we do not have the implementation details of `TEE_GetObjectInfo1`, we can infer that this function likely accesses the persistent object represented by the `object` handle and retrieves its metadata (e.g., size, type, access permissions).
   - Since the `object` handle is tainted, any operations performed within `TEE_GetObjectInfo1` that depend on this handle will also be tainted.

4. **Taint Propagation**:
   - If `TEE_GetObjectInfo1` successfully retrieves information about the object, it will populate the `object_info` structure. The contents of this structure will depend on the state of the object, which is tainted due to the tainted `object` handle.
   - The taint will propagate to the `object_info` structure, meaning that any fields within `object_info` that are populated based on the tainted object will also be considered tainted.

5. **Sinks**:
   - The `object_info` structure is passed by reference, and if any of its fields are used later in the program without proper validation, they could lead to security vulnerabilities.
   - Since the function returns a `TEE_Result`, it is important to note that the result itself does not carry taint but indicates the success or failure of the operation. However, if the operation fails, it may not populate `object_info`, and thus the state of `object_info` should be considered carefully in subsequent operations.

### Summary
- **Tainted Input**: `object` (derived from tainted data in `read_raw_object`)
- **Taint Propagation**: 
  - Taint is propagated to the `object_info` structure, which is populated based on the tainted `object` handle.
- **Sinks**: 
  - The fields of the `object_info` structure can be considered sinks if they are used later in the program without proper validation.

In conclusion, the `TEE_GetObjectInfo1` function propagates tainted data from the `object` handle to the `object_info` structure. Care should be taken in subsequent operations that utilize the `object_info` to ensure that any tainted data is handled appropriately to avoid security vulnerabilities.</pre>

Since the implementation of the <code>TEE_GetObjectInfo1</code> function is unavailable, we will perform a taint analysis based on the function signature and its expected behavior.

CWE-20: Tainted `params[1].memref.size` is used in `TEE_ReadObjectData` without proper validation of the data size, leading to potential out-of-bounds writes if the size is manipulated.

<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `&lt;param_types&gt;`, `&lt;params&gt;`

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes four parameters:
1. `session`: A pointer to a session (not tainted).
2. `command`: A command identifier (not tainted).
3. `param_types`: A parameter type identifier (tainted).
4. `params`: An array of `TEE_Param` structures (tainted).

### Control Flow Analysis
The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of `command`. The commands are:
- `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW`
- `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW`
- `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE`

Each case calls a different function, passing the tainted parameters `param_types` and `params`.

### Data Flow Analysis
1. **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW**
   - Calls `create_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
   - **Tainted Data Flow**: `param_types` and `params` are passed directly to `create_raw_object`, maintaining their taint.

2. **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW**
   - Calls `read_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
   - **Tainted Data Flow**: `param_types` and `params` are passed directly to `read_raw_object`, maintaining their taint.

3. **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE**
   - Calls `delete_object(param_types, params)`.
   - **Tainted Data Flow**: `param_types` and `params` are passed directly to `delete_object`, maintaining their taint.

4. **Default Case**
   - Logs an error message using `EMSG` and returns `TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
   - **Tainted Data Flow**: No taint propagation occurs here since the command is unsupported.

### Data Aliases
- The `params` parameter is an array of `TEE_Param` structures. Each element of this array can be considered a potential alias for the tainted data, as the contents of `params` can be modified by the functions called in the switch cases.
- If any of the functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`) modify the contents of `params`, the taint will propagate through those modifications.

### Operations that Propagate Taint
- The direct passing of `param_types` and `params` to the respective functions in each case propagates the taint.
- If any of the called functions perform operations that modify the contents of `params`, the taint will continue to propagate through those modifications.

### Implicit Flow
- The control flow of the `switch` statement itself does not introduce new taint but determines which function is called based on the value of `command`. The taint is implicitly carried through the control flow since the execution of different cases depends on the tainted input.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Inputs**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Tainted Outputs**: The outputs of `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, and `delete_object` may also be tainted depending on their implementations.
- **Data Aliases**: `params` as an array of `TEE_Param` structures.
- **Taint Propagation**: Directly passed to the respective functions, maintaining taint throughout the function.

In conclusion, the taint analysis shows that the tainted parameters flow through the function without being sanitized or modified, and the taint is propagated to the called functions. The potential for further taint propagation exists within those functions, depending on their implementations.</pre>

<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: read_raw_object</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `read_raw_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` flows through the function, identify any new taint propagation, and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`)

### Function Overview
The function `read_raw_object` takes two parameters:
1. `param_types`: A parameter type identifier (not tainted).
2. `params`: An array of `TEE_Param` structures (tainted).

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Parameter Type Check**
   - The function first checks if `param_types` matches the expected type (`exp_param_types`).
   - If it does not match, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: No taint propagation occurs here since this is a validation step.

2. **Object ID Handling**
   - `obj_id_sz` is set to `params[0].memref.size`, which is tainted.
   - `obj_id` is allocated using `TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0)`. If allocation fails, it returns `TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`.
   - `TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz)` copies the contents of `params[0].memref.buffer` (tainted) to `obj_id`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from `params[0].memref.buffer` is propagated to `obj_id`.

3. **Data Buffer Handling**
   - `data_sz` is set to `params[1].memref.size`, which is tainted.
   - `data` is allocated using `TEE_Malloc(data_sz, 0)`. If allocation fails, it returns `TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from `params[1].memref.size` is propagated to `data`.

4. **Opening Persistent Object**
   - The function calls `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` with `obj_id`, which is tainted, and checks if the object can be opened.
   - If the object cannot be opened, it logs an error and frees `obj_id` and `data`, returning the error code.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from `obj_id` is used in this operation, but it does not propagate further.

5. **Getting Object Info**
   - The function calls `TEE_GetObjectInfo1` with the `object` handle. If it fails, it logs an error and goes to the exit.
   - **Taint Propagation**: No new taint is introduced here.

6. **Buffer Size Check**
   - The function checks if `object_info.dataSize` is greater than `data_sz`. If it is, it sets `params[1].memref.size` to `object_info.dataSize` and returns `TEE_ERROR_SHORT_BUFFER`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from `data_sz` is propagated to `params[1].memref.size`.

7. **Reading Object Data**
   - The function calls `TEE_ReadObjectData` to read data into the `data` buffer. If successful, it copies the read data back to `params[1].memref.buffer` using `TEE_MemMove`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from `data` is propagated to `params[1].memref.buffer` if the read is successful.

8. **Final Size Update**
   - The function sets `params[1].memref.size` to `read_bytes`, which is the number of bytes effectively filled.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from `read_bytes` is propagated to `params[1].memref.size`.

### Sinks
- **Sinks**: The function writes to `params[1].memref.buffer`, which is a tainted output. If the data read from the persistent object is sensitive, it could be considered a sink for tainted data.
- The function also logs errors using `EMSG`, which could potentially expose tainted data if the error messages include sensitive information.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (specifically `params[0].memref.buffer` and `params[1].memref.size`)
- **Tainted Outputs**: `params[1].memref.buffer` and `params[1].memref.size` may contain tainted data after the function execution.
- **New Taint Propagation**: 
  - `obj_id` receives taint from `params[0].memref.buffer`.
  - `data` receives taint from `params[1].memref.size`.
  - `params[1].memref.size` is updated with taint from `object_info.dataSize`.
- **Sinks**: Tainted data reaches `params[1].memref.buffer`, which is a potential sink for sensitive information.

In conclusion, the `read_raw_object` function propagates tainted data from the `params` input to its outputs, and it also has potential sinks where sensitive data could be exposed. Care should be taken to ensure that sensitive information is handled securely throughout the function.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_ReadObjectData</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To continue the taint analysis, we will focus on how tainted data could affect the parameters `arg0` and `arg2` (which correspond to `params[0]` and `params[1]` in the `read_raw_object` function) and track the flow of tainted data through the external function `TEE_ReadObjectData`. 

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (specifically `params[0]` and `params[1]`)
- **Parameters of Interest**:
  - `arg0`: Corresponds to `params[0]` (the object ID).
  - `arg2`: Corresponds to `params[1]` (the output buffer).

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Tainted Input Parameters**:
   - `params[0].memref.buffer`: This buffer is tainted as it is derived from the input to the `read_raw_object` function.
   - `params[1].memref.buffer`: This buffer is also tainted, as it is intended to receive data read from a persistent object.

2. **Object ID Handling**:
   - The size of the object ID is taken from `params[0].memref.size`, and the buffer is allocated and populated with `TEE_MemMove` from `params[0].memref.buffer`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from `params[0].memref.buffer` is propagated to `obj_id`, which is used in subsequent operations.

3. **Data Buffer Handling**:
   - The size for the output buffer is taken from `params[1].memref.size`, and a new buffer `data` is allocated.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from `params[1].memref.size` is propagated to `data`.

4. **Reading Object Data**:
   - The function `TEE_ReadObjectData` is called with the following parameters:
     - `object`: A handle to the persistent object (not tainted).
     - `data`: A buffer that is tainted (allocated based on `params[1].memref.size`).
     - `object_info.dataSize`: The size of the data to read (not tainted).
     - `&amp;read_bytes`: A pointer to a variable that will hold the number of bytes read (not tainted).
   - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from `data` is propagated into the `TEE_ReadObjectData` function. If `TEE_ReadObjectData` reads data into `data`, it will affect the taint status of `params[1].memref.buffer`.

5. **Copying Data Back**:
   - After reading, if the read operation is successful, the function uses `TEE_MemMove` to copy the contents of `data` back to `params[1].memref.buffer`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from `data` is propagated to `params[1].memref.buffer`, which is now tainted with the data read from the persistent object.

6. **Updating Output Size**:
   - The function updates `params[1].memref.size` with the number of bytes effectively filled (`read_bytes`).
   - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from `read_bytes` (which is derived from the read operation) is propagated to `params[1].memref.size`.

### Summary of Taint Propagation for `arg0` and `arg2`
- **arg0 (`params[0]`)**:
  - Tainted data flows from the input to `params[0].memref.buffer`, which is copied to `obj_id`. 
  - The taint is used in the call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject`, but it does not propagate further beyond this point.

- **arg2 (`params[1]`)**:
  - Tainted data flows from `params[1].memref.size` to the allocation of `data`.
  - The taint from `data` is propagated into the call to `TEE_ReadObjectData`.
  - After reading, the taint from `data` is copied back to `params[1].memref.buffer` using `TEE_MemMove`, making `params[1].memref.buffer` tainted with potentially sensitive data.
  - The size of the output buffer (`params[1].memref.size`) is updated with the number of bytes read, which is also tainted.

### Potential Sinks
- The tainted data reaches `params[1].memref.buffer`, which is a potential sink for sensitive information. If this buffer contains sensitive data, it could lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.
- The function also logs errors using `EMSG`, which could potentially expose tainted data if the error messages include sensitive information.

### Conclusion
In summary, the taint analysis shows that:
- Tainted data from `params[0]` affects `arg0` but does not propagate beyond the object ID handling.
- Tainted data from `params[1]` significantly affects `arg2`, propagating through the function and potentially leading to sensitive data being written to `params[1].memref.buffer`. Care should be taken to ensure that this data is handled securely to prevent leaks or unauthorized access.</pre>

To analyze the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.<br><br>### Tainted Parameters<br>- **Tainted Parameters**: <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;params&gt;</code><br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> takes four parameters:<br>1. <code>session</code>: A pointer to a session (not tainted).<br>2. <code>command</code>: A command identifier (not tainted).<br>3. <code>param_types</code>: A parameter type identifier (tainted).<br>4. <code>params</code>: An array of <code>TEE_Param</code> structures (tainted).<br><br>### Control Flow Analysis<br>The function uses a <code>switch</code> statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of <code>command</code>. The commands are:<br>- <code>TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW</code><br>- <code>TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW</code><br>- <code>TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE</code><br><br>Each case calls a different function, passing the tainted parameters <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code>.<br><br>### Data Flow Analysis<br>1. **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW**<br>   - Calls <code>create_raw_object(param_types, params)</code>.<br>   - **Tainted Data Flow**: <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> are passed directly to <code>create_raw_object</code>, maintaining their taint.<br><br>2. **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW**<br>   - Calls <code>read_raw_object(param_types, params)</code>.<br>   - **Tainted Data Flow**: <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> are passed directly to <code>read_raw_object</code>, maintaining their taint.<br><br>3. **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE**<br>   - Calls <code>delete_object(param_types, params)</code>.<br>   - **Tainted Data Flow**: <code>param_types</code> and <code>params</code> are passed directly to <code>delete_object</code>, maintaining their taint.<br><br>4. **Default Case**<br>   - Logs an error message using <code>EMSG</code> and returns <code>TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED</code>.<br>   - **Tainted Data Flow**: No taint propagation occurs here since the command is unsupported.<br><br>### Data Aliases<br>- The <code>params</code> parameter is an array of <code>TEE_Param</code> structures.

To analyze the <code>read_raw_object</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>params</code> flows through the function, identify any new taint propagation, and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- **Tainted Input**: <code>params</code> (from the previous function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>)<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>read_raw_object</code> takes two parameters:<br>1. <code>param_types</code>: A parameter type identifier (not tainted).<br>2. <code>params</code>: An array of <code>TEE_Param</code> structures (tainted).<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Parameter Type Check**<br>   - The function first checks if <code>param_types</code> matches the expected type (<code>exp_param_types</code>).<br>   - If it does not match, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>.<br>   - **Taint Propagation**: No taint propagation occurs here since this is a validation step.<br><br>2. **Object ID Handling**<br>   - <code>obj_id_sz</code> is set to <code>params[0].memref.size</code>, which is tainted.<br>   - <code>obj_id</code> is allocated using <code>TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0)</code>. If allocation fails, it returns <code>TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY</code>.<br>   - <code>TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz)</code> copies the contents of <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> (tainted) to <code>obj_id</code>.<br>   - **Taint Propagation**: The taint from <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> is propagated to <code>obj_id</code>.<br><br>3. **Data Buffer Handling**<br>   - <code>data_sz</code> is set to <code>params[1].memref.size</code>, which is tainted.<br>   - <code>data</code> is allocated using <code>TEE_Malloc(data_sz, 0)</code>.

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `&lt;param_types&gt;`, `&lt;params&gt;`

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes four parameters:
1. `session`: Unused in this analysis.
2. `command`: A command identifier.
3. `param_types`: Tainted parameter.
4. `params`: Tainted parameter (array of `TEE_Param`).

### Control Flow Analysis
The function uses a switch statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of `command`. The commands correspond to different operations that utilize the tainted parameters.

### Taint Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - `param_types` and `params` are initially tainted.

2. **Switch Statement**:
   - The `command` variable is not tainted, but it controls which case is executed. The flow of taint depends on the value of `command`.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW`**:
     - Calls `create_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
     - **Taint Propagation**: Both `param_types` and `params` are passed to this function, propagating the taint.
   
   - **Case `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW`**:
     - Calls `read_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
     - **Taint Propagation**: Again, both `param_types` and `params` are passed, propagating the taint.
   
   - **Case `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE`**:
     - Calls `delete_object(param_types, params)`.
     - **Taint Propagation**: Both parameters are passed, propagating the taint.

4. **Default Case**:
   - If `command` does not match any of the specified cases, it logs an error message and returns `TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: No taint propagation occurs here since no tainted parameters are used.

### Data Aliases
- The `params` parameter is an array of `TEE_Param`, which may contain pointers or references to other data structures. If any of the elements in `params` are modified within the called functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`), the taint may propagate further through those modifications.

### Operations Propagating Taint
- The function does not perform any direct assignments or modifications to the tainted parameters. However, the calls to the other functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`) are critical as they may manipulate the tainted data.

### Implicit Flow
- The control flow through the switch statement is dependent on the value of `command`. If `command` is influenced by external input, it can lead to different paths of execution, which may affect how taint is propagated based on which function is called.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Flow**:
  - Tainted parameters are passed to the respective command functions based on the value of `command`.
  - Taint is propagated to the called functions, which may further manipulate the data.
- **No direct modifications** to the tainted parameters within `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`.
- **Control dependencies**: The flow of execution is dependent on the value of `command`, which can affect which tainted data is processed.

### Conclusion
The `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function effectively propagates tainted data through its command handling mechanism, relying on external functions to process the tainted parameters. Care should be taken in those functions to ensure that taint is managed appropriately.</pre>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `delete_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (specifically, `params[0]`)

### Function Overview
The `delete_object` function is designed to delete a persistent object based on the parameters provided. It checks the parameter types, allocates memory for the object ID, and performs operations to delete the object.

### Taint Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The `params` array is tainted, specifically `params[0]`, which is expected to contain a memory reference to the object ID to be deleted.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   - The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected type (`exp_param_types`).
   - If the types do not match, it returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: No taint propagation occurs here, but if the check fails, the function exits without further processing.

3. **Extracting Object ID Size**:
   - `obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;`
   - The size of the object ID is taken from the tainted `params[0]`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: `obj_id_sz` is now indirectly tainted since it is derived from a tainted parameter.

4. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);`
   - Memory is allocated for `obj_id` based on the tainted size.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The allocation itself does not propagate taint, but it prepares for the next step.

5. **Copying Object ID**:
   - `TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);`
   - The content of `params[0].memref.buffer` (which is tainted) is copied into `obj_id`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: `obj_id` now contains tainted data, as it directly copies from the tainted buffer.

6. **Opening Persistent Object**:
   - `res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(...)` is called with `obj_id` (tainted).
   - **Taint Propagation**: The function uses the tainted `obj_id` to attempt to open a persistent object. If this function processes the `obj_id`, it may lead to further taint propagation.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - If `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns the result.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The error handling does not affect taint propagation but indicates that the tainted data was used in a critical operation.

8. **Closing and Deleting the Object**:
   - `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(object);` is called if the object is successfully opened.
   - **Taint Propagation**: This operation does not directly propagate taint but acts on the object identified by the tainted `obj_id`.

9. **Freeing Memory**:
   - `TEE_Free(obj_id);` is called to free the allocated memory.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The freeing of memory does not propagate taint but cleans up the tainted data.

### Sinks
- The primary sink in this function is the call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject`, which uses the tainted `obj_id`. If this function performs any operations that depend on the integrity of `obj_id`, it could lead to security vulnerabilities if the data is not properly validated.
- The logging of errors with `EMSG` also represents a potential sink, as it may expose information about the tainted data if the error message includes sensitive information.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- **Tainted Input**: `params[0]` (specifically, `params[0].memref.buffer`)
- **Flow**:
  - Tainted data flows from `params[0]` to `obj_id` through `TEE_MemMove`.
  - The tainted `obj_id` is used in `TEE_OpenPersistentObject`, which is a critical operation.
- **Taint Propagation**: 
  - Taint is propagated from `params[0]` to `obj_id` and subsequently used in a sensitive operation.
- **Sinks**: 
  - `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` and error logging with `EMSG` are potential sinks for tainted data.

### Conclusion
The `delete_object` function effectively propagates tainted data from the input parameters to critical operations that could affect the security of the system. Care should be taken to ensure that the data being processed is validated and sanitized to prevent potential vulnerabilities.</pre>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To continue the taint analysis based on the previous results, we will focus on how tainted data can affect multiple parameters, specifically `arg0` and `arg2`, in the context of the `delete_object` function. We will also pay attention to data aliases and tainted data operations.

### Function Overview
The `delete_object` function processes the `params` array, particularly `params[0]`, which is tainted. The analysis will track how this tainted data can affect other parameters, specifically `arg0` and `arg2`, and how it propagates through the function.

### Tainted Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The `params` array is tainted, particularly `params[0]`, which contains a memory reference to the object ID to be deleted.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   - The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected type. If it does not, the function returns early without further processing.
   - **Taint Propagation**: No taint propagation occurs here, but if the check fails, the function exits without affecting `arg0` or `arg2`.

3. **Extracting Object ID Size**:
   - `obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;`
   - The size of the object ID is derived from the tainted `params[0]`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: `obj_id_sz` is now indirectly tainted.

4. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);`
   - Memory is allocated for `obj_id` based on the tainted size.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The allocation itself does not propagate taint, but it prepares for the next step.

5. **Copying Object ID**:
   - `TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);`
   - The content of `params[0].memref.buffer` (tainted) is copied into `obj_id`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: `obj_id` now contains tainted data, as it directly copies from the tainted buffer.

6. **Opening Persistent Object**:
   - `res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(...)` is called with `obj_id` (tainted).
   - **Taint Propagation**: The function uses the tainted `obj_id` to attempt to open a persistent object. If this function processes the `obj_id`, it may lead to further taint propagation.

### Tracking Tainted Data to `arg0` and `arg2`

- **arg0**: 
  - If `arg0` is intended to represent the object ID or some related data, it could be directly affected by the tainted `obj_id`. 
  - If `arg0` is assigned or manipulated based on the value of `obj_id`, it will inherit the taint from `params[0]`.

- **arg2**: 
  - If `arg2` is used in conjunction with `obj_id` or is derived from operations involving `obj_id`, it could also be affected by the tainted data.
  - For example, if `arg2` is used to store the result of an operation that involves `obj_id`, it will also be tainted.

### Data Aliases
- The `params` array itself can be seen as a data alias for the memory that is being manipulated. Specifically, `params[0].memref.buffer` is a pointer to the actual data that is being copied into `obj_id`.
- If `arg0` or `arg2` are pointers or references to the same memory location as `obj_id`, they will also be tainted.

### Tainted Data Operations
- The critical operation that propagates taint is the `TEE_MemMove` function, which copies data from the tainted `params[0].memref.buffer` to `obj_id`. This operation ensures that any data in `params[0]` is now present in `obj_id`, which is then used in subsequent operations.
- The call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` uses the tainted `obj_id`, which could lead to further operations that may expose or manipulate the tainted data.

### Sinks
- The primary sink remains the call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject`, which uses the tainted `obj_id`. If this function processes the `obj_id` without proper validation, it could lead to security vulnerabilities.
- Any subsequent operations that utilize `arg0` or `arg2` after they have been assigned or derived from `obj_id` could also represent sinks for tainted data.

### Conclusion
The `delete_object` function effectively propagates tainted data from the input parameters to critical operations that could affect the security of the system. The tainted data from `params[0]` flows into `obj_id`, which is then used in sensitive operations. If `arg0` or `arg2` are derived from or assigned values based on `obj_id`, they will also inherit the taint. Care should be taken to ensure that all data is validated and sanitized to prevent potential vulnerabilities.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: 
  - `param_types` (uint32_t)
  - `params` (TEE_Param[4])

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes a session pointer, a command identifier, a parameter type, and an array of parameters. Based on the command, it calls one of three functions: `create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, or `delete_object`. If the command is not recognized, it logs an error and returns an error code.

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - `param_types` and `params` are initially tainted as they are passed into the function.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of `command`. The flow of taint will depend on which case is executed.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW**:
     - Calls `create_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
     - **Taint Propagation**: 
       - `param_types` and `params` are passed directly to `create_raw_object`, maintaining their taint.
     - **Data Aliases**: If `create_raw_object` uses pointers or references to `params`, the taint will propagate through those references.

   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW**:
     - Calls `read_raw_object(param_types, params)`.
     - **Taint Propagation**: 
       - Similar to the previous case, `param_types` and `params` are passed directly, maintaining their taint.
     - **Data Aliases**: Again, if `read_raw_object` uses pointers or references to `params`, the taint will propagate.

   - **Case: TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE**:
     - Calls `delete_object(param_types, params)`.
     - **Taint Propagation**: 
       - `param_types` and `params` are passed directly, maintaining their taint.
     - **Data Aliases**: If `delete_object` uses pointers or references to `params`, the taint will propagate.

4. **Default Case**:
   - If the command does not match any of the cases, it logs an error message and returns `TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: No taint propagation occurs here since no tainted parameters are used in the logging or return statement.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Parameters**: `param_types` and `params` are tainted upon entry.
- **Taint Propagation**: 
  - In all three cases, the taint from `param_types` and `params` is propagated to the respective functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`).
- **Data Aliases**: 
  - If any of the called functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`) use pointers or references to `params`, the taint will continue to propagate through those references.
- **Implicit Flow**: The control flow of the `switch` statement determines which function is called, but does not affect the taint status of the parameters themselves.

### Conclusion
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` effectively propagates taint from its parameters to the called functions based on the command provided. Care should be taken in the implementation of the called functions to ensure that they handle the tainted data appropriately.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: delete_object</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `delete_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (from the previous function)

### Function Overview
The `delete_object` function is responsible for deleting a persistent object based on the parameters provided. It checks the parameter types, allocates memory for the object ID, copies the object ID from the `params`, and then attempts to open and delete the object.

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The `params` array is tainted as it is passed into the function.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   - The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected `exp_param_types`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: No taint propagation occurs here, but if the check fails, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`, and no further processing occurs.

3. **Extracting Object ID Size**:
   - `obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;`
   - **Taint Propagation**: The size of the object ID is derived from `params[0].memref.size`, which is tainted. Therefore, `obj_id_sz` is also tainted.

4. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);`
   - **Taint Propagation**: The allocation itself does not propagate taint, but if `obj_id_sz` is derived from tainted data, it could lead to unsafe memory allocation if not properly validated.

5. **Copying Object ID**:
   - `TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);`
   - **Taint Propagation**: The contents of `params[0].memref.buffer` are copied into `obj_id`. Since `params` is tainted, the data in `obj_id` is also tainted after this operation.

6. **Opening Persistent Object**:
   - `res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(...)`
   - The function attempts to open a persistent object using the tainted `obj_id` and `obj_id_sz`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` uses tainted data (`obj_id`), which could lead to security issues if the object ID is derived from untrusted input.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - If `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns the result.
   - **Taint Propagation**: The error message does not use tainted data directly, but the failure to open the object is a consequence of using tainted data.

8. **Closing and Deleting the Object**:
   - `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(object);`
   - This function is called if the object is successfully opened. It does not directly involve tainted data but operates on the `object` handle obtained from the previous call.

9. **Freeing Memory**:
   - `TEE_Free(obj_id);`
   - The allocated memory for `obj_id` is freed, which does not affect taint propagation.

### Sinks
- **Tainted Data Reaching Sinks**:
  - The tainted data reaches the `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` function, which is a potential sink. If this function does not properly validate the object ID, it could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of persistent objects.
  - The logging of the error message in case of failure also indicates that tainted data could be involved in error reporting, although it does not directly expose the taint.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Input**: `params` is tainted upon entry.
- **Taint Propagation**:
  - `obj_id_sz` is tainted as it is derived from `params[0].memref.size`.
  - `obj_id` becomes tainted after copying data from `params[0].memref.buffer`.
  - The call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` uses tainted data, which is a significant concern.
- **Sinks**: 
  - The function `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` is a critical sink where tainted data is used, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities if not handled correctly.

### Conclusion
The `delete_object` function propagates taint from the `params` input through to the `obj_id`, which is then used in a critical operation that could affect the security of the system. Care should be taken to ensure that the data in `params` is validated and sanitized before being used in sensitive operations.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_Free</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_Free` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `arg0` (which is the pointer to the memory allocated in the previous function `delete_object`) flows through this function. Since the implementation of `TEE_Free` is not provided, we will focus on the expected behavior of a typical memory deallocation function and how it interacts with tainted data.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `arg0` (the pointer to the memory allocated for `obj_id` in the `delete_object` function)

### Function Overview
The `TEE_Free` function is typically responsible for deallocating memory that was previously allocated. It takes a pointer as an argument and releases the associated memory back to the system.

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The input `arg0` (which points to the memory allocated for `obj_id`) is tainted because it was derived from tainted data in the `delete_object` function.

2. **Memory Deallocation**:
   - The function `TEE_Free(arg0)` is called to free the memory pointed to by `arg0`.
   - **Taint Propagation**: 
     - The act of freeing memory itself does not propagate taint in the traditional sense, as it does not involve any data manipulation or transfer. However, the pointer being freed is tainted, indicating that the memory being deallocated was previously allocated based on tainted data.

3. **Potential Sinks**:
   - **Tainted Data Reaching Sinks**: 
     - In the context of `TEE_Free`, there are no direct sinks that process or expose the tainted data. The function is primarily concerned with memory management.
     - However, if the memory being freed was used in any subsequent operations (e.g., if the memory was still accessible after being freed), there could be risks associated with dangling pointers or use-after-free vulnerabilities. This is not directly applicable in this case since `TEE_Free` is a memory management function.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Input**: `arg0` is tainted upon entry, as it points to memory that was allocated based on tainted data.
- **Taint Propagation**: 
  - The `TEE_Free` function does not propagate taint in the traditional sense, as it does not manipulate or expose the data. It simply deallocates memory.
- **Sinks**: 
  - There are no direct sinks in `TEE_Free` that process tainted data. The function&#x27;s purpose is to manage memory, and it does not involve any operations that would expose or further propagate taint.

### Conclusion
The `TEE_Free` function handles the deallocation of memory that was previously allocated based on tainted data. While it does not propagate taint or expose vulnerabilities directly, it is essential to ensure that the memory being freed is not accessed afterward, as this could lead to security issues such as use-after-free vulnerabilities. Proper memory management practices should be followed to mitigate such risks.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `&lt;param_types&gt;`, `&lt;params&gt;`

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes four parameters:
1. `session`: A pointer to a session (not tainted).
2. `command`: A command identifier (not tainted).
3. `param_types`: A parameter type identifier (tainted).
4. `params`: An array of `TEE_Param` structures (tainted).

### Control Flow Analysis
The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which command to execute based on the `command` parameter. The commands are:
- `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_WRITE_RAW`
- `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_READ_RAW`
- `TA_SECURE_STORAGE_CMD_DELETE`

### Data Flow Analysis
1. **Tainted Parameters**:
   - `param_types` and `params` are tainted inputs to the function.

2. **Control Dependency**:
   - The flow of taint is dependent on the value of `command`. Each case in the switch statement will determine which function is called, and the taint will propagate based on the command executed.

3. **Explicit Data Flow**:
   - Each case in the switch statement calls a different function, passing the tainted parameters:
     - `create_raw_object(param_types, params)`: Tainted data flows into this function.
     - `read_raw_object(param_types, params)`: Tainted data flows into this function.
     - `delete_object(param_types, params)`: Tainted data flows into this function.

4. **Implicit Data Flow**:
   - The `command` parameter is not tainted, but it controls which function is executed. This means that the execution path is influenced by the value of `command`, which can lead to different handling of the tainted data.

### Data Aliases
- The `params` parameter is an array of `TEE_Param` structures. If any of these structures are modified within the called functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`), the taint will propagate to those modifications.
- If any of the functions modify the contents of `params`, the taint will persist in those modifications.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- **Tainted Inputs**: `param_types`, `params`
- **Tainted Outputs**: The output of the called functions (`create_raw_object`, `read_raw_object`, `delete_object`) may also be tainted depending on how they handle the tainted parameters.
- **Control Dependency**: The flow of taint is dependent on the `command` value, which determines which function is executed.
- **Data Aliases**: The `params` array can have its contents modified, which can lead to further taint propagation.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the tainted parameters `param_types` and `params` flow through the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function and are passed to other functions based on the command. The taint is propagated through explicit data flow (function calls) and is influenced by control dependencies (the value of `command`). Any modifications to the `params` array within the called functions will also propagate the taint.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: delete_object</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `delete_object` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` flows through the function, identify any new taint propagation, and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `params` (specifically, `params[0]`)

### Function Overview
The `delete_object` function is designed to delete a persistent object based on the parameters provided. It checks the parameter types, allocates memory for the object ID, and attempts to delete the object.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Tainted Input**:
   - The `params` array is passed into the function, and specifically, `params[0]` is used to extract the object ID.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   - The function first checks if `param_types` matches the expected type (`exp_param_types`). If it does not match, the function returns an error (`TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`). This check does not propagate taint but ensures that the function is called with the correct parameters.

3. **Extracting Object ID**:
   - `obj_id_sz = params[0].memref.size;`
     - The size of the object ID is taken from the tainted `params[0]`. This means that `obj_id_sz` is now influenced by tainted data.
   - `obj_id = TEE_Malloc(obj_id_sz, 0);`
     - Memory is allocated for `obj_id`. The allocation itself does not propagate taint, but it is important to note that `obj_id` will eventually hold tainted data.
   - `TEE_MemMove(obj_id, params[0].memref.buffer, obj_id_sz);`
     - This line copies the contents of `params[0].memref.buffer` (which is tainted) into `obj_id`. This operation propagates the taint from `params[0]` to `obj_id`.

4. **Object Deletion Logic**:
   - `res = TEE_OpenPersistentObject(...)`
     - The function attempts to open a persistent object using the tainted `obj_id`. If `obj_id` contains malicious or unexpected data, it could lead to security issues. The result of this operation (`res`) is influenced by the tainted data.
   - If the object is successfully opened, the function proceeds to delete it with `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(object);`. The taint from `obj_id` has now reached a critical operation that could affect the system&#x27;s state.

5. **Memory Management**:
   - `TEE_Free(obj_id);`
     - The allocated memory for `obj_id` is freed. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.

### Taint Propagation Summary
- **Tainted Input**: `params[0]` is tainted.
- **Taint Propagation**:
  - The size of the object ID (`obj_id_sz`) is derived from tainted data.
  - The contents of `params[0].memref.buffer` are copied to `obj_id`, propagating the taint.
  - The tainted `obj_id` is used in a critical operation (`TEE_OpenPersistentObject`), which could lead to security vulnerabilities if the data is not validated properly.

### Sinks
- The function `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` is a potential sink for tainted data. If `obj_id` contains malicious data, it could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of persistent objects.
- The function `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1` is also a sink, as it performs an action based on the potentially tainted object handle.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `delete_object` function takes tainted input from `params`, propagates the taint through memory allocation and data copying, and ultimately uses the tainted data in critical operations that could affect system security. Proper validation and sanitization of the input data are essential to prevent potential vulnerabilities.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_Free</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_Free` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `arg0` (which is the pointer to the memory allocated in the previous function) flows through this function. Since the implementation of `TEE_Free` is not provided, we will focus on the conceptual aspects of taint propagation and potential sinks.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: `arg0` (the pointer to the memory allocated for `obj_id` in the `delete_object` function)

### Function Overview
The `TEE_Free` function is typically used to deallocate memory that was previously allocated. In this context, it is called to free the memory pointed to by `obj_id`, which contains potentially tainted data.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Tainted Input**:
   - The input to `TEE_Free` is `arg0`, which is a pointer to the memory that was allocated and populated with tainted data from `params[0].memref.buffer` in the `delete_object` function.

2. **Memory Deallocation**:
   - The primary purpose of `TEE_Free` is to release the memory allocated for `obj_id`. The function itself does not process or manipulate the contents of the memory; it simply frees the allocated block.
   - Since `TEE_Free` does not perform any operations on the data itself, there is no new taint propagation within this function. The taint does not change or propagate further; it simply exists in the memory that is being freed.

3. **Sinks**:
   - The `TEE_Free` function is not a sink in the traditional sense of data flow analysis, as it does not perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities or data leakage. Its role is limited to memory management.
   - However, it is important to note that if the memory being freed contained sensitive or tainted data, that data could potentially be exposed if not handled properly after deallocation. For example, if the memory was not cleared before being freed, remnants of the tainted data could remain in memory, leading to potential security risks if that memory is later reused.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `TEE_Free` function takes a tainted pointer (`arg0`) as input, but it does not propagate taint or perform any operations that could lead to vulnerabilities. Its primary function is to deallocate memory. However, it is crucial to ensure that any sensitive data is properly handled before deallocation to prevent potential exposure of tainted data remnants. Overall, while `TEE_Free` itself does not introduce new taint propagation, it plays a critical role in memory management and should be used with caution in the context of tainted data.</pre>
