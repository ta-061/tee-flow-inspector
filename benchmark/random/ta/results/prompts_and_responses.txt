# External Function: TEE_GenerateRandom
## Prompt:
As a program analyst, is it possible to use a call TEE_GenerateRandom as a sink when performing taint analysis? 
If so which parameters need to be checked for taint. Please answer yes or no without additional explanation. 
If yes, please indicate the corresponding parameters. For example, the system function can be used as a sink, and the first parameter needs to be checked as (system; 1).


## Response:
Yes. The corresponding parameters to check for taint are (TEE_GenerateRandom; 1).
