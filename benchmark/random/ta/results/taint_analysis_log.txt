### DITING Rules System Prompt:
### RAG Status: Disabled
You are analyzing code that runs as an OP-TEE Trusted Application (TA).

OP-TEE Domain Facts (background only, non-prescriptive):
- Architecture & trust boundary: OP-TEE separates the Normal World (REE) and the Trusted World (TEE). TAs run in the TEE. Data carried by TEE_Param originate from the Normal World.
- TEE_Param and paramTypes: The four parameter slots are typed via TEE_PARAM_TYPES(). MEMREF_INPUT is read by the TA, MEMREF_OUTPUT is written by the TA, MEMREF_INOUT is both read and written.
- Shared vs private memory: A memref’s .buffer usually refers to shared memory supplied by the Normal World client and mapped between worlds; memory allocated via TEE_Malloc() is private to the TA unless explicitly shared.
- Memory operations: TEE_MemMove() and TEE_MemFill() behave like C memmove/memset; lengths use size_t (unsigned).
- Randomness: TEE_GenerateRandom(void *buf, size_t len) fills a TA-provided buffer with random bytes generated inside the TEE.
- Command dispatch: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint() dispatches by cmd_id; error codes (TEE_Result) are returned per the TA’s implementation.
- Output intent: Writing to a MEMREF_OUTPUT parameter indicates the TA intends to return data to the caller; whether data require transformation depends on the TA’s design.

## Function 1: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint
### Prompt:
Function to analyze: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint
Tainted parameters: <param_types>, <params>

You MUST respond first with a one-line JSON (no code fences):
{"function":"TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint","propagation":[],"sanitizers":[],"sinks":[],"evidence":[],"rule_matches":[]}

Tasks:
1) Using ONLY the provided code, list taint propagation steps (LHS <- RHS) into "propagation".
2) If any checks/sanitization exist (e.g., param_types check, bounds, TEE_CheckMemoryAccessRights), list them in "sanitizers" with evidence lines.
3) List concrete sinks (e.g., TEE_MemMove, snprintf) in "sinks" with evidence lines.
4) If any DITING rule matches, append its `id` to "rule_matches" and add evidence.
5) Keep the JSON minimal; after it, add up to 3 bullets if necessary.

Code to analyze:
101: TEE_Result TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint(void *sess_ctx,
102: 			uint32_t cmd_id,
103: 			uint32_t param_types, TEE_Param params[4])
104: {
105: 	(void)&sess_ctx;
106: 
107: 	switch (cmd_id) {
108: 	case TA_RANDOM_CMD_GENERATE:

110: 	default:
111: 		return TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS;

113: }

### Response:
{"function":"TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint","propagation":[],"sanitizers":["param_types check: line 111"],"sinks":[],"evidence":[],"rule_matches":[]}

- The function checks for valid command IDs and returns an error for invalid ones, which is a form of sanitization.

=== POLICY (NO RAG) ===
- Use ONLY the provided code and (optional) upstream context. Do not assume anything else.

=== FALSE-POSITIVE GUARDRAILS (NEGATIVE RULES) ===
- Data originating from `TEE_GenerateRandom` is NON-SENSITIVE by default.
  Copying such data to `MEMREF_OUTPUT` MUST NOT be flagged as `unencrypted_output`.
- Allocators/deallocators (e.g., `TEE_Malloc`, `TEE_Free`) are NOT sinks.
- Emit a finding ONLY if BOTH are true:
  (1) attacker-controlled or sensitive taint reaches a dangerous sink, AND
  (2) no effective validation/sanitization prevents exploitation.

=== WHAT TO INFER (NO MANUAL NAMES PROVIDED) ===
- Infer the current function name from the code’s signature. If unavailable, set "function":"unknown".
- Initialize TAINTED from the upstream context if provided. Otherwise, assume no taint unless the code clearly ingests untrusted input.
- Track explicit dataflow only (assignments, parameter passing, buffer writes/reads). For control dependence, annotate as "implicit:<var>".

3) Record dataflow:
   - Append "LHS <- RHS @ <file>:<line>" to "propagation" for each explicit flow/alias.
4) Identify validators/sanitizers and add them to "sanitizers" with evidence lines (bounds checks, type checks, TEE_CheckMemoryAccessRights, length caps).
5) Identify dangerous sinks and add them to "sinks" with evidence lines.
   - Exclude alloc/free; treat cross-world or shared-memory writes as sinks only when tainted data/length is used.
6) Check parameter-type consistency:
   - If `param_types` declaration conflicts with actual reads/writes (e.g., reading from NONE/OUTPUT), record in "evidence" with lines; map to `weak_input_validation` only if it enables attacker influence to reach a sink.

================================================================================

## Function 1: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint
### Prompt:
Function to analyze: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint
Tainted parameters: <param_types>, <params>

You MUST respond first with a one-line JSON (no code fences):
{"function":"TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint","propagation":[],"sanitizers":[],"sinks":[],"evidence":[],"rule_matches":[]}

Tasks:
1) Using ONLY the provided code, list taint propagation steps (LHS <- RHS) into "propagation".
2) If any checks/sanitization exist (e.g., param_types check, bounds, TEE_CheckMemoryAccessRights), list them in "sanitizers" with evidence lines.
3) List concrete sinks (e.g., TEE_MemMove, snprintf) in "sinks" with evidence lines.
4) If any DITING rule matches, append its `id` to "rule_matches" and add evidence.
5) Keep the JSON minimal; after it, add up to 3 bullets if necessary.

Code to analyze:
101: TEE_Result TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint(void *sess_ctx,
102: 			uint32_t cmd_id,
103: 			uint32_t param_types, TEE_Param params[4])
104: {
105: 	(void)&sess_ctx;
106: 
107: 	switch (cmd_id) {
108: 	case TA_RANDOM_CMD_GENERATE:
109: 		return random_number_generate(param_types, params);
110: 	default:
111: 		return TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS;
112: 	}
113: }

### Response:
{"function":"TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint","propagation":[],"sanitizers":["param_types check: line 111"],"sinks":[],"evidence":[],"rule_matches":[]}

- The function checks for valid command IDs and returns an error for invalid ones, which is a form of sanitization.

## Function 2: random_number_generate
### Prompt:
Continue the taint analysis for the next step in the call chain.

You will receive:
- Code to analyze:

- (Optional) Upstream context: {upstream_context}   # e.g., previously tainted symbol (often a single item)

=== POLICY (NO RAG) ===
- Use ONLY the provided code and (optional) upstream context. Do not assume anything else.

=== FALSE-POSITIVE GUARDRAILS (NEGATIVE RULES) ===
- Data originating from `TEE_GenerateRandom` is NON-SENSITIVE by default.
  Copying such data to `MEMREF_OUTPUT` MUST NOT be flagged as `unencrypted_output`.
- Allocators/deallocators (e.g., `TEE_Malloc`, `TEE_Free`) are NOT sinks.
- Emit a finding ONLY if BOTH are true:
  (1) attacker-controlled or sensitive taint reaches a dangerous sink, AND
  (2) no effective validation/sanitization prevents exploitation.

=== WHAT TO INFER (NO MANUAL NAMES PROVIDED) ===
- Infer the current function name from the code’s signature. If unavailable, set "function":"unknown".
- Initialize TAINTED from the upstream context if provided. Otherwise, assume no taint unless the code clearly ingests untrusted input.
- Track explicit dataflow only (assignments, parameter passing, buffer writes/reads). For control dependence, annotate as "implicit:<var>".

=== OUTPUT CONTRACT (STRICT — EXACTLY TWO LINES) ===
Line 1: a single JSON object with these fields:

Line 2: a single line starting with FINDINGS= and containing JSON:
FINDINGS={"items":[{"rule":"unencrypted_output|weak_input_validation|shared_memory_overwrite","file":"<path>","line":123,"why":"<one sentence>","evidence":"<file>:<line>","code_excerpt":"<short>"}]}

Rules for Line 2:
- Always print the FINDINGS line; if nothing qualifies, output: FINDINGS={"items":[]}
- Allowed rule values are exactly: unencrypted_output, weak_input_validation, shared_memory_overwrite.
- Each item MUST include concrete code evidence (`<file>:<line>`). If unknown, use evidence:"unknown".
- DO NOT print any extra text before/after these two lines. No additional bullets or explanations.

=== ANALYSIS STEPS (APPLY TO THE GIVEN CODE) ===
1) Parse the function signature to infer the function name (or "unknown").
2) Initialize TAINTED from upstream context (if given). Otherwise, derive only when the code clearly ingests untrusted input.
3) Record dataflow:
   - Append "LHS <- RHS @ <file>:<line>" to "propagation" for each explicit flow/alias.
4) Identify validators/sanitizers and add them to "sanitizers" with evidence lines (bounds checks, type checks, TEE_CheckMemoryAccessRights, length caps).
5) Identify dangerous sinks and add them to "sinks" with evidence lines.
   - Exclude alloc/free; treat cross-world or shared-memory writes as sinks only when tainted data/length is used.
6) Check parameter-type consistency:
   - If `param_types` declaration conflicts with actual reads/writes (e.g., reading from NONE/OUTPUT), record in "evidence" with lines; map to `weak_input_validation` only if it enables attacker influence to reach a sink.

## Function 3: TEE_MemMove
### Prompt:

=== ANALYSIS STEPS (APPLY TO THE GIVEN CODE) ===
1) Parse the function signature to infer the function name (or "unknown").
2) Initialize TAINTED from upstream context (if any).
3) For EACH potentially tainted parameter/symbol:
   a) Track explicit dataflow and append "LHS <- RHS @ <file>:<line>" to "propagation".
   b) Record validators/sanitizers with evidence lines (bounds checks, type checks, access rights, length caps) in "sanitizers".
   c) Identify dangerous sinks and WHICH parameter/symbol they use; add them to "sinks" with evidence lines.
4) Check parameter-type consistency:
   - If `param_types` declaration conflicts with actual reads/writes (e.g., reading from NONE/OUTPUT), record in "evidence" with lines; map to `weak_input_validation` only if it enables attacker influence to reach a sink.
5) If any DITING rule matches, list its `id` in "rule_matches" with supporting evidence.

## Vulnerability Analysis
### Prompt:
Based on the taint analysis above, decide if there is an ACTUAL vulnerability in the analyzed code path.

## Decision Criteria
1. Does tainted data actually reach a dangerous sink?
2. Are there validation / sanitization steps that stop exploitation?
3. What specific conditions make this exploitable?
