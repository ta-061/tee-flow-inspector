<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flow.

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes the following parameters:
- `void *sess`: Unused session parameter.
- `uint32_t cmd`: Command identifier.
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters that can be tainted.

### Tainted Parameters
- The parameters `pt` and `params` are considered tainted. The `params` array is particularly important as it can contain sensitive data that may be manipulated or accessed by the commands invoked.

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Tainted Parameters**:
   - `params` is an array of `TEE_Param`, which can contain multiple fields that may be tainted.
   - `pt` is a `uint32_t` that may also be influenced by tainted data.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of `cmd`. The flow of execution is dependent on the value of `cmd`, which is not tainted but determines which function is called next.

3. **Function Calls**:
   - Each case in the switch statement calls a different function, passing `pt` and `params` as arguments. The taint from `params` and `pt` will propagate into these functions:
     - `read_persist_value(pt, params)`
     - `write_persist_value(pt, params)`
     - `delete_persist_value(pt, params)`

4. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `params` array is passed by reference to the functions. This means that any modifications to `params` within those functions will affect the original data, maintaining the taint.
   - If any of the functions (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`) modify the contents of `params`, the taint will persist.

5. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The taint from `params` is propagated to the called functions. If any of these functions perform operations that read from or write to `params`, the taint will continue to propagate.
   - The `pt` parameter is also passed to these functions, which may influence how they handle the `params` data.

6. **Implicit Flow**:
   - The control flow of the switch statement is dependent on the value of `cmd`. If `cmd` is influenced by tainted data (e.g., if it is derived from user input), then the entire flow of execution can be considered tainted.
   - The default case logs an error message if an unsupported command is received, but this does not affect the taint propagation since it does not modify or use the `params`.

### Summary of Taint Data Flow
- **Tainted Inputs**: `params` and `pt` are tainted.
- **Control Dependency**: The value of `cmd` determines which command is executed, potentially influenced by tainted data.
- **Function Calls**: Each command function (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`) receives tainted parameters, allowing for further propagation of taint.
- **Data Aliases**: `params` is passed by reference, meaning any changes within the called functions will affect the original data.
- **Taint Propagation**: Taint from `params` and `pt` is propagated into the called functions, and any modifications within those functions will maintain the taint.

### Conclusion
The `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function effectively propagates tainted data through its control flow and function calls. The taint from `params` and `pt` can lead to potential security vulnerabilities if not handled properly in the subsequent functions. It is crucial to ensure that the called functions validate and sanitize the tainted data before processing it further.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: write_persist_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `write_persist_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `write_persist_value` takes the following parameters:
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters, which is tainted.

### Tainted Input
- The `params` array is tainted, specifically `params[0]` and `params[1]`, which are expected to be memory references containing sensitive data.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The `params` array is passed to the function, and it is assumed to be tainted from the previous function.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   - The function checks if `pt` matches the expected parameter types (`exp_pt`). If it does not match, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`, and no further processing occurs. This check does not affect taint propagation.

3. **Accessing Tainted Data**:
   - `name_buf` is assigned from `params[0].memref.buffer`, which is tainted. This means `name_buf` is now tainted.
   - `name_buf_sz` is assigned from `params[0].memref.size`, which is also tainted indirectly since it is derived from the tainted `params`.

4. **Validation of Tainted Data**:
   - The function calls `check_valid_value(name_buf)`, which uses the tainted `name_buf`. If this function returns an error, it logs an error message and returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`. This does not propagate taint but validates the tainted data.

5. **Conditional Logic**:
   - The function checks if `name_buf` starts with a vendor prefix or a rollback protection string. If it does, the `overwrite` flag is set to `false`. This logic does not affect taint propagation but controls subsequent operations.

6. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `value_sz` is assigned from `params[1].memref.size`, which is tainted. This means `value_sz` is also tainted.
   - The function allocates memory for `value` using `TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)`. If the allocation fails, it returns `TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`. The allocation itself does not propagate taint but is dependent on the tainted `value_sz`.

7. **Copying Tainted Data**:
   - The function uses `TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz);` to copy data from the tainted `params[1].memref.buffer` to the newly allocated `value`. This operation propagates the taint from `params[1]` to `value`.

8. **Further Conditional Logic**:
   - The function checks if `name_buf` starts with the vendor prefix and whether vendor creation is enabled. If not, it logs an error and sets `res` to `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`. This does not propagate taint but controls the flow based on tainted data.
   - If `name_buf` does not match `BOOTFIRM_VER`, it calls `write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite);`, which uses tainted data (`name_buf`, `name_buf_sz`, `value`, and `value_sz`). This is a potential sink for tainted data.
   - If it matches `BOOTFIRM_VER`, it calls `increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz);`, which also uses tainted data (`value` and `value_sz`), representing another potential sink.

9. **Memory Deallocation**:
   - The function calls `TEE_Free(value);` to free the allocated memory. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.

10. **Return Value**:
    - The function returns `res`, which may indicate success or failure based on the operations performed. The return value itself does not carry taint.

### Summary of Taint Data Flow
- **Tainted Inputs**: `params[0]` and `params[1]` are tainted.
- **Taint Propagation**:
  - `name_buf` and `name_buf_sz` are tainted from `params[0]`.
  - `value_sz` is tainted from `params[1]`.
  - `value` becomes tainted after copying from `params[1].memref.buffer`.
- **Sinks**:
  - The function calls `write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware`, both of which use tainted data (`name_buf`, `name_buf_sz`, `value`, and `value_sz`). These represent potential sinks where tainted data could lead to security vulnerabilities if not properly validated or sanitized.

### Conclusion
The `write_persist_value` function effectively propagates tainted data from the `params` array through various operations, including memory allocation and data copying. The function also contains potential sinks where tainted data could be processed, highlighting the need for careful validation and handling of the tainted inputs to prevent security issues.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: increase_boot_firmware</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `increase_boot_firmware` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `new_ver_str` and `new_ver_sz` (derived from the previous function `write_persist_value`) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `increase_boot_firmware` takes the following parameters:
- `char *new_ver_str`: A pointer to a string representing the new firmware version, which is tainted.
- `uint32_t new_ver_sz`: The size of the new firmware version string, which is also tainted.

### Tainted Input
- The `new_ver_str` and `new_ver_sz` are tainted inputs derived from the `params[1].memref.buffer` and `params[1].memref.size` in the `write_persist_value` function.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The parameters `new_ver_str` and `new_ver_sz` are tainted as they are passed from the previous function, which received them from the tainted `params` array.

2. **Rollback Protection Check**:
   - The function first checks if the system is rollback protected by calling `is_rollback_protected()`. This function does not use any tainted data, so it does not affect taint propagation.
   - The function then checks if the new version string is incremental by calling `is_version_incremental(new_ver_str, new_ver_sz)`. This function uses the tainted `new_ver_str` and `new_ver_sz`. If this check fails, it logs an error message and returns `TEE_ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`. This does not propagate taint but validates the tainted data.

3. **Calling a Sink**:
   - If the rollback protection check passes and the version is incremental, the function calls `write_value(BOOTFIRM_VER, strlen(BOOTFIRM_VER) + 1, new_ver_str, new_ver_sz, true);`.
   - This call uses the following parameters:
     - `BOOTFIRM_VER`: A constant string that is not tainted.
     - `strlen(BOOTFIRM_VER) + 1`: The length of the constant string, which is also not tainted.
     - `new_ver_str`: Tainted input from the previous function.
     - `new_ver_sz`: Tainted input from the previous function.
     - `true`: A boolean value that is not tainted.

4. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The taint from `new_ver_str` and `new_ver_sz` is propagated into the `write_value` function. This means that any operations performed within `write_value` that utilize these parameters will also be working with tainted data.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the result of the `write_value` call, which may indicate success or failure. The return value itself does not carry taint.

### Summary of Taint Data Flow
- **Tainted Inputs**: `new_ver_str` and `new_ver_sz` are tainted.
- **Taint Propagation**:
  - The taint from `new_ver_str` and `new_ver_sz` is propagated into the `is_version_incremental` function, which checks the validity of the new version string.
  - The taint is further propagated into the `write_value` function call, which represents a potential sink for tainted data.
  
- **Sinks**:
  - The call to `write_value` is a significant sink where tainted data (`new_ver_str` and `new_ver_sz`) is processed. If `write_value` does not properly validate or sanitize this data, it could lead to security vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion
The `increase_boot_firmware` function effectively propagates tainted data from the previous function through its operations. The tainted inputs `new_ver_str` and `new_ver_sz` are used in a validation check and subsequently passed to a sink function (`write_value`). It is crucial to ensure that the `write_value` function handles this tainted data appropriately to prevent potential security issues.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: is_rollback_protected</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `is_rollback_protected` function for taint data flow, we will track how tainted input flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `is_rollback_protected` does not take any parameters. Instead, it checks if rollback protection is enabled by reading a value associated with `ROLLBACK_PROT`.

### Tainted Input
- The function does not directly receive any tainted input parameters. However, it is called from the `increase_boot_firmware` function, which uses tainted data (`new_ver_str` and `new_ver_sz`) to determine if the firmware version update is permitted.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - The function initializes a local variable `res` to `TEE_SUCCESS`, a `value_sz` to `MAX_SIMPLE_VALUE_SIZE`, and a `value` array of size `MAX_SIMPLE_VALUE_SIZE`. The `count` variable is also declared but not initialized.

2. **Reading Rollback Protection Value**:
   - The function calls `read_value(ROLLBACK_PROT, strlen(ROLLBACK_PROT) + 1, value, value_sz, &amp;count);`.
   - The parameters passed to `read_value` are:
     - `ROLLBACK_PROT`: A constant string that is not tainted.
     - `strlen(ROLLBACK_PROT) + 1`: The length of the constant string, which is also not tainted.
     - `value`: A local buffer where the result will be stored, which is not tainted.
     - `value_sz`: The size of the buffer, which is not tainted.
     - `&amp;count`: A pointer to a variable that will hold the count of items read, which is also not tainted.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - Since the function does not use any tainted data directly, there is no new taint propagation within `is_rollback_protected`. The function operates entirely on local variables and constants.

4. **Return Value**:
   - If `read_value` returns `TEE_SUCCESS`, the function logs a message indicating that rollback protection is enabled and returns `true`. If `read_value` fails, it returns `false`.
   - The return value itself does not carry taint, as it is a boolean indicating the state of rollback protection.

### Summary of Taint Data Flow
- **Tainted Inputs**: There are no direct tainted inputs in this function.
- **Taint Propagation**: 
  - No new taint is propagated within this function since it only uses local variables and constants.
  
- **Sinks**: 
  - There are no sinks in this function. The function does not process any tainted data, nor does it write or modify any external state based on tainted inputs.

### Conclusion
The `is_rollback_protected` function does not propagate any tainted data, as it operates solely on local variables and constants. It checks the state of rollback protection by reading a value associated with `ROLLBACK_PROT`, but this operation does not involve any tainted data from the previous function. The function&#x27;s return value is a simple boolean indicating whether rollback protection is enabled, and it does not carry any taint. Thus, it serves as a validation check without introducing any security risks related to tainted data.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: read_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `read_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `read_value` takes the following parameters:
- `char *name`: A pointer to a string representing the name of the object to read, which is tainted.
- `uint32_t name_sz`: The size of the name string, which is also tainted.
- `char *value`: A pointer to a buffer where the read value will be stored, which is not tainted initially.
- `uint32_t value_sz`: The size of the buffer, which is not tainted initially.
- `uint32_t *count`: A pointer to a variable that will hold the count of bytes read, which is not tainted initially.

### Tainted Input
- The parameters `name` and `name_sz` are tainted inputs derived from the previous function, specifically from the `params` array in `write_persist_value`.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The `name` and `name_sz` parameters are tainted as they are passed from the previous function, which received them from the tainted `params` array.

2. **Getting the Full Object Name**:
   - The function calls `get_named_object_name(name, name_sz, name_full, &amp;name_full_sz);`.
   - The parameters passed to this function are:
     - `name`: Tainted input.
     - `name_sz`: Tainted input.
     - `name_full`: A local buffer where the full object name will be stored, which is not tainted.
     - `&amp;name_full_sz`: A pointer to a variable that will hold the size of the full name, which is not tainted.
   - If `get_named_object_name` returns an error, the function returns that error code. This does not propagate taint but validates the tainted data.

3. **Opening the Persistent Object**:
   - The function calls `TEE_OpenPersistentObject(storageid, name_full, name_full_sz, flags, &amp;h);`.
   - The parameters passed to this function are:
     - `storageid`: A constant or previously defined identifier, which is not tainted.
     - `name_full`: The full name of the object, which is derived from the tainted `name` but is not tainted itself.
     - `name_full_sz`: The size of the full name, which is not tainted.
     - `flags`: A combination of access flags, which are not tainted.
     - `&amp;h`: A pointer to a handle for the opened object, which is not tainted.
   - If `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` fails, it logs an error message and returns the error code. This does not propagate taint.

4. **Reading Object Data**:
   - The function calls `TEE_ReadObjectData(h, value, value_sz, count);`.
   - The parameters passed to this function are:
     - `h`: The handle to the opened object, which is not tainted.
     - `value`: A buffer where the read data will be stored, which is not tainted initially.
     - `value_sz`: The size of the buffer, which is not tainted initially.
     - `count`: A pointer to a variable that will hold the count of bytes read, which is not tainted initially.
   - If `TEE_ReadObjectData` fails, it logs an error message. This operation does not propagate taint but reads data into the `value` buffer.

5. **Closing the Object**:
   - The function calls `TEE_CloseObject(h);` to close the opened object. This does not affect taint propagation.

6. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the result of the last operation (`res`), which may indicate success or failure. The return value itself does not carry taint.

### Summary of Taint Data Flow
- **Tainted Inputs**: `name` and `name_sz` are tainted.
- **Taint Propagation**:
  - The taint from `name` and `name_sz` is used in the `get_named_object_name` function, but it does not propagate further.
  - The `value` buffer is not tainted initially, and the function does not read any tainted data into it. Instead, it reads data from a persistent object based on the `name` provided.

- **Sinks**:
  - The function does not have any sinks that process tainted data. The `value` buffer is populated with data from a persistent object, but this data is not derived from the tainted inputs directly.

### Conclusion
The `read_value` function does not propagate tainted data from its inputs (`name` and `name_sz`) into the `value` buffer. Instead, it reads data from a persistent object based on the provided name. The function operates on local variables and constants, and while it performs important operations, it does not introduce any new taint or process tainted data directly. Thus, it does not present any immediate security risks related to tainted data.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: get_named_object_name</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `get_named_object_name` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `get_named_object_name` takes the following parameters:
- `char *name_orig`: A pointer to the original name of the object, which is tainted.
- `uint32_t name_orig_size`: The size of the original name, which is also tainted.
- `char *name`: A pointer to a buffer where the full object name will be constructed, which is not tainted initially.
- `uint32_t *name_size`: A pointer to a variable that will hold the size of the constructed name, which is not tainted initially.

### Tainted Input
- The parameters `name_orig` and `name_orig_size` are tainted inputs derived from the previous function, specifically from the `params` array in `read_value`.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The `name_orig` and `name_orig_size` parameters are tainted as they are passed from the previous function, which received them from the tainted `params` array.

2. **Parameter Validation**:
   - The function checks if the combined size of `name_orig_size` and the length of `named_value_prefix` exceeds `TEE_OBJECT_ID_MAX_LEN`. If it does, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`. This check does not propagate taint but validates the tainted input.

3. **Constructing the Full Object Name**:
   - The function uses `TEE_MemMove(name, named_value_prefix, pref_len);` to copy the prefix into the `name` buffer. The `name` buffer is not tainted at this point, as it is being initialized with a constant prefix.
   - The function then concatenates the original name by calling `TEE_MemMove(name + pref_len, name_orig, name_orig_size);`. This operation copies the tainted `name_orig` into the `name` buffer starting at the position after the prefix.
   - At this point, the `name` buffer becomes tainted because it now contains data from the tainted `name_orig`.

4. **Setting the Size of the Constructed Name**:
   - The function sets `*name_size = name_orig_size + pref_len;`. This operation does not affect taint propagation, as it only updates the size variable.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `TEE_SUCCESS`, indicating that the operation was successful. The return value itself does not carry taint.

### Summary of Taint Data Flow
- **Tainted Inputs**: `name_orig` and `name_orig_size` are tainted.
- **Taint Propagation**:
  - The taint from `name_orig` is propagated into the `name` buffer when it is concatenated with the prefix. After this operation, the `name` buffer is considered tainted.
  
- **Sinks**:
  - The function does not have any sinks that process tainted data directly. However, the `name` buffer, which is now tainted, will be used in subsequent operations (specifically in the `read_value` function) where it may be involved in accessing sensitive data.

### Conclusion
The `get_named_object_name` function propagates tainted data from its inputs (`name_orig` and `name_orig_size`) into the `name` buffer, which becomes tainted after the concatenation operation. While the function itself does not present any immediate security risks, the tainted `name` buffer will be used in subsequent operations, such as in the `read_value` function, where it may lead to accessing sensitive data. It is essential to ensure that any further processing of the tainted `name` is handled securely to prevent potential vulnerabilities.</pre>

<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_MemMove</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_MemMove` function in the context of taint data flow, we will consider how it interacts with the parameters of the functions we&#x27;ve previously analyzed, particularly focusing on how tainted data can affect the parameters `arg0`, `arg1`, and `arg2`. Since the implementation of `TEE_MemMove` is unavailable, we will assume it behaves similarly to standard memory copy functions, such as `memcpy`, which copy data from a source to a destination.

### Function Overview
The `TEE_MemMove` function is expected to copy a specified number of bytes from a source memory location to a destination memory location. The parameters typically include:
- `void *dest`: The destination buffer where data will be copied.
- `const void *src`: The source buffer from which data will be copied.
- `size_t n`: The number of bytes to copy.

### Taint Flow Analysis of TEE_MemMove

1. **Tainted Data Sources**:
   - The tainted data originates from the `params` array in the previous functions, specifically:
     - `params[0].memref.buffer` (used in `name_orig`).
     - `params[1].memref.buffer` (used in `value`).
   - These buffers can contain sensitive data that may be manipulated or accessed.

2. **Tracking Tainted Data Operations**:
   - In the context of the functions we&#x27;ve analyzed, `TEE_MemMove` is used in the following ways:
     - **In `get_named_object_name`**:
       - `TEE_MemMove(name, named_value_prefix, pref_len);` copies a constant prefix to the `name` buffer. This operation does not introduce taint.
       - `TEE_MemMove(name + pref_len, name_orig, name_orig_size);` copies the tainted `name_orig` into the `name` buffer. After this operation, the `name` buffer becomes tainted.
     - **In `write_persist_value`**:
       - `TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz);` copies data from the tainted `params[1].memref.buffer` into the `value` buffer. After this operation, the `value` buffer becomes tainted.

3. **Parameter Tracking**:
   - **arg0**: This could represent the destination buffer in `TEE_MemMove`. If `arg0` is the `name` buffer in `get_named_object_name`, it becomes tainted after copying `name_orig`. If `arg0` is the `value` buffer in `write_persist_value`, it becomes tainted after copying from `params[1].memref.buffer`.
   - **arg1**: This could represent the source buffer in `TEE_MemMove`. If `arg1` is `name_orig`, it is tainted when passed to `get_named_object_name`. If `arg1` is `params[1].memref.buffer`, it is tainted when passed to `write_persist_value`.
   - **arg2**: This represents the number of bytes to copy. It is typically a size parameter and does not carry taint itself. However, if it is derived from a tainted source (e.g., `name_orig_size` or `value_sz`), it could indirectly affect the operations.

### Summary of Taint Data Flow in TEE_MemMove
- **Tainted Inputs**: 
  - `name_orig` and `name_orig_size` are tainted inputs that affect the `name` buffer in `get_named_object_name`.
  - `params[1].memref.buffer` and `params[1].memref.size` are tainted inputs that affect the `value` buffer in `write_persist_value`.

- **Taint Propagation**:
  - The `name` buffer becomes tainted after copying from `name_orig`.
  - The `value` buffer becomes tainted after copying from `params[1].memref.buffer`.

- **Potential Sinks**:
  - The tainted `name` buffer is used in subsequent operations (e.g., in `read_value`), which may access sensitive data.
  - The tainted `value` buffer is used in `write_value`, which may also process sensitive data.

### Conclusion
The `TEE_MemMove` function plays a critical role in propagating tainted data through the system. It is essential to ensure that any buffers that receive data from tainted sources are properly validated and sanitized before being used in sensitive operations. The tracking of tainted data through `TEE_MemMove` highlights the importance of understanding how data flows through the system and the potential risks associated with unvalidated inputs.</pre>

Any data within this array is considered tainted.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function uses a <code>switch</code> statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of <code>cmd</code>. The control flow is dependent on the value of <code>cmd</code>, which is not tainted directly but can influence the execution path.<br><br>3. **Case Analysis**:<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>read_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - The <code>params</code> array is passed directly to this function, propagating the taint.<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>write_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Again, the <code>params</code> array is passed directly, propagating the taint.<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>delete_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - The <code>params</code> array is passed directly, propagating the taint.<br>   - **Default Case**:<br>     - If <code>cmd</code> does not match any of the cases, an error message is logged, and <code>TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED</code> is returned. No taint propagation occurs here.<br><br>4. **Data Aliases**:<br>   - The <code>params</code> array is a pointer to an array of <code>TEE_Param</code> structures. If any of these structures are modified within the called functions (<code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, <code>delete_persist_value</code>), the taint will propagate through those modifications.<br>   - If any of the functions modify the contents of <code>params</code>, those modifications will also be tainted.<br><br>5. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - The taint from <code>params</code> is propagated to the return values of the functions called within each case. If any of these functions return a result that depends on the tainted <code>params</code>, the result will also be tainted.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>params</code> array is tainted upon entry into <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>.<br>- The taint is propagated to the called functions based on the value of <code>cmd</code>.<br>- The taint remains through the function calls, and any modifications to <code>params</code> within those functions will continue to propagate the taint.<br>- The control flow based on <code>cmd</code> does not introduce new taint but determines which tainted data is processed.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis shows that the <code>params</code> array is the primary source of taint in the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function. The taint propagates through the function calls based on the command executed, and any modifications to the <code>params</code> array within those functions will maintain the taint. The function does not introduce new taint but relies on the tainted input to determine its behavior.

To analyze the <code>write_persist_value</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>params</code> (from the previous function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>write_persist_value</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>pt</code>: A parameter type (of type <code>uint32_t</code>).<br>- <code>params</code>: An array of <code>TEE_Param</code> structures (of size <code>TEE_NUM_PARAMS</code>).<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The <code>params</code> array is tainted as it is passed from the previous function. Specifically, <code>params[0]</code> and <code>params[1]</code> are of interest since they are used in the function.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - The <code>params</code> array is tainted upon entry into <code>write_persist_value</code>. Specifically, <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> and <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> are tainted.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function first checks if <code>pt</code> matches the expected parameter types (<code>exp_pt</code>). If it does not match, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>, and no taint propagation occurs.<br><br>3. **Tainted Data Usage**:<br>   - **Name Buffer**:<br>     - <code>name_buf</code> is assigned from <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code>, which is tainted. Therefore, <code>name_buf</code> is also tainted.<br>     - <code>name_buf_sz</code> is assigned from <code>params[0].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted but is used to determine the size of the tainted data.<br><br>4. **Validation Check**:<br>   - The function calls <code>check_valid_value(name_buf)</code>. If this function returns <code>TEE_SUCCESS</code>, it indicates that the tainted <code>name_buf</code> is valid. If it fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>. This does not propagate taint but checks the validity of the tainted data.<br><br>5. **Overwrite Logic**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with a vendor prefix or the <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code> string. If it does, the <code>overwrite</code> flag is set to <code>false</code>. This logic does not introduce new taint but uses the tainted <code>name_buf</code> to control the flow.<br><br>6. **Value Buffer**:<br>   - <code>value_sz</code> is assigned from <code>params[1].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted.<br>   - <code>value</code> is allocated using <code>TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)</code>. If the allocation fails, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY</code>, and no taint propagation occurs.<br><br>7. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - The function uses <code>TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)</code>. Here, the tainted data from <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> is copied into the <code>value</code> buffer. Thus, <code>value</code> becomes tainted.<br><br>8. **Conditional Logic**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with the vendor prefix and whether <code>CFG_FIOVB_VENDOR_CREATE</code> is enabled. If not, it sets <code>res</code> to <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code> and logs an error message. This does not propagate taint but controls the flow based on tainted data.<br>   - If <code>name_buf</code> does not match <code>BOOTFIRM_VER</code>, it calls <code>write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite)</code>. Here, both <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code> are tainted, so the call to <code>write_value</code> propagates the taint.<br>   - If <code>name_buf</code> matches <code>BOOTFIRM_VER</code>, it calls <code>increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz)</code>, where <code>value</code> is tainted.<br><br>9. **Memory Cleanup**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_Free(value)</code> to free the allocated memory for <code>value</code>. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.<br><br>10. **Return Value**:<br>    - The function returns <code>res</code>, which may be influenced by the tainted data if either <code>write_value</code> or <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> modifies the state based on the tainted inputs.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>params</code> array is tainted upon entry into <code>write_persist_value</code>.<br>- The taint propagates to <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code> through assignments and memory operations.<br>- The function checks the validity of the tainted <code>name_buf</code> but does not remove taint.<br>- Tainted data reaches potential sinks in the calls to <code>write_value</code> and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>, which may further process or store the tainted data.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis of <code>write_persist_value</code> shows that the function effectively propagates tainted data from the <code>params</code> array to local variables and potentially to external functions. The taint remains throughout the function, and the final return value may be influenced by the tainted inputs, especially in the context of the called functions.

To analyze the <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>new_ver_str</code> (which is derived from the <code>params</code> array in the previous function <code>write_persist_value</code>) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>new_ver_str</code>: A pointer to a character string representing the new firmware version (tainted input).<br>- <code>new_ver_sz</code>: The size of the new firmware version string (of type <code>uint32_t</code>).<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The <code>new_ver_str</code> is tainted as it is passed from the <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> in the <code>write_persist_value</code> function, which was previously tainted.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - The <code>new_ver_str</code> is tainted upon entry into <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> since it is derived from the tainted <code>params</code> in the previous function.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function first checks two conditions:<br>     - If the system is rollback protected by calling <code>is_rollback_protected()</code>.<br>     - If the new version string is incremental by calling <code>is_version_incremental(new_ver_str, new_ver_sz)</code>.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - The taint from <code>new_ver_str</code> is propagated into the call to <code>is_version_incremental(new_ver_str, new_ver_sz)</code>. If this function uses <code>new_ver_str</code>, it will also be working with tainted data.<br>   - If either of the conditions fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</code>. This does not propagate taint but checks the validity of the tainted data.<br><br>4. **Sinks**:<br>   - If both conditions pass, the function proceeds to call <code>write_value(BOOTFIRM_VER, strlen(BOOTFIRM_VER) + 1, new_ver_str, new_ver_sz, true)</code>.<br>   - Here, <code>new_ver_str</code> is passed as an argument to <code>write_value</code>, which means the taint is propagated to this function call.

To analyze the <code>is_rollback_protected</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input (in this case, the context of the taint from the previous function) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>is_rollback_protected</code> does not take any parameters. Instead, it checks whether rollback protection is enabled by reading a value associated with <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code>.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The tainted input in this context is indirectly related to the previous function&#x27;s tainted data (<code>new_ver_str</code> from <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>). However, since <code>is_rollback_protected</code> does not directly use any parameters, we will analyze how it interacts with the system state and whether it affects the taint flow.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial State**:<br>   - The function does not receive any tainted parameters directly. However, it is called in the context of a function (<code>increase_boot_firmware</code>) that processes tainted data. Therefore, the function&#x27;s behavior may be influenced by the tainted context.<br><br>2. **Reading Rollback Protection Value**:<br>   - The function calls <code>read_value(ROLLBACK_PROT, strlen(ROLLBACK_PROT) + 1, value, value_sz, &amp;count)</code>.<br>   - The <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code> string is a constant and not tainted. The function attempts to read a value associated with this key into the <code>value</code> buffer.<br>   - The result of this operation is stored in <code>res</code>. If <code>res</code> is <code>TEE_SUCCESS</code>, it indicates that rollback protection is enabled.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - Since <code>is_rollback_protected</code> does not directly use any tainted data (like <code>new_ver_str</code>), there is no new taint propagation within this function.<br>   - The function&#x27;s logic is based on the result of <code>read_value</code>, which may or may not depend on previously tainted data, but this is not directly observable in the function itself.<br><br>4. **Return Value**:<br>   - If <code>read_value</code> succeeds, the function logs a message indicating that rollback protection is enabled and returns <code>true</code>. If it fails, it returns <code>false</code>.<br>   - The return value does not propagate any taint; it simply indicates the state of rollback protection.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>is_rollback_protected</code> function does not directly handle any tainted input.<br>- There is no new taint propagation within this function since it does not use any parameters or variables that are tainted.<br>- The function interacts with the system state by reading a value associated with <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code>, but this does not involve tainted data.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis of <code>is_rollback_protected</code> shows that this function does not propagate tainted data. It operates independently of the tainted context established by previous functions. The function&#x27;s purpose is to check the state of rollback protection without introducing or modifying any taint. Therefore, it does not represent a sink for tainted data, and its return value is purely a boolean indicating the status of rollback protection.

To analyze the <code>read_value</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input (specifically, the <code>name</code> parameter, which is derived from the previous function) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>read_value</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>name</code>: A pointer to a character string representing the name of the object to read (tainted input).<br>- <code>name_sz</code>: The size of the name string (of type <code>uint32_t</code>).<br>- <code>value</code>: A pointer to a buffer where the read value will be stored (not tainted initially).<br>- <code>value_sz</code>: The size of the buffer for the value (of type <code>uint32_t</code>).<br>- <code>count</code>: A pointer to a variable that will hold the number of bytes read (not tainted initially).<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The <code>name</code> parameter is tainted as it is derived from the <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code> string in the context of the previous function calls. The taint originates from the context of the <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> function, which was influenced by the tainted <code>new_ver_str</code>.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - The <code>name</code> parameter is tainted upon entry into <code>read_value</code>. The <code>value</code> buffer is not tainted initially, but it will be populated with data read from the persistent storage.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function first calls <code>get_named_object_name(name, name_sz, name_full, &amp;name_full_sz)</code>.<br>   - The <code>name</code> parameter is passed directly to this function, propagating the taint. If <code>get_named_object_name</code> uses <code>name</code>, it will also be working with tainted data.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - If <code>get_named_object_name</code> returns an error, the function returns that error code, and no further taint propagation occurs.<br>   - If successful, the function proceeds to call <code>TEE_OpenPersistentObject(storageid, name_full, name_full_sz, flags, &amp;h)</code>. The <code>name_full</code> variable is populated by <code>get_named_object_name</code>, and if it contains any tainted data, it will also be tainted. However, since <code>name_full</code> is derived from <code>name</code>, it is also tainted.<br><br>4. **Reading Object Data**:<br>   - The function then calls <code>TEE_ReadObjectData(h, value, value_sz, count)</code>. This function attempts to read data from the persistent object identified by the handle <code>h</code> into the <code>value</code> buffer.<br>   - If <code>TEE_ReadObjectData</code> succeeds, the <code>value</code> buffer will now contain data that may be tainted, depending on the contents of the persistent object. If the persistent object was created or modified using tainted data, the data read into <code>value</code> will also be tainted.<br><br>5. **Error Handling**:<br>   - If <code>TEE_ReadObjectData</code> fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns the error code. This does not propagate taint but indicates a failure in reading the data.<br><br>6. **Closing the Object**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_CloseObject(h)</code> to close the persistent object handle. This does not affect taint propagation.<br><br>7. **Return Value**:<br>   - The function returns the result of the read operation (<code>res</code>). If the read was successful, the <code>value</code> buffer may now contain tainted data, depending on the state of the persistent object.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>name</code> parameter is tainted upon entry into <code>read_value</code>.<br>- The taint propagates through the function, particularly into the call to <code>get_named_object_name</code>, which may also process tainted data.<br>- If the read operation is successful, the <code>value</code> buffer will contain data that may be tainted, depending on the contents of the persistent object.<br>- The function does not introduce new taint but may propagate existing taint into the <code>value</code> buffer.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis of <code>read_value</code> shows that the function effectively propagates tainted data from the <code>name</code> parameter. The taint remains throughout the function, and if the read operation is successful, the <code>value</code> buffer may contain tainted data. This represents a potential sink for tainted data, as the contents of <code>value</code> could be used in subsequent operations, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

To analyze the <code>get_named_object_name</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input (specifically, the <code>name_orig</code> parameter) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>get_named_object_name</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>name_orig</code>: A pointer to a character string representing the original name of the object (tainted input).<br>- <code>name_orig_size</code>: The size of the original name string (of type <code>uint32_t</code>).<br>- <code>name</code>: A pointer to a buffer where the concatenated name will be stored (not tainted initially).<br>- <code>name_size</code>: A pointer to a variable that will hold the size of the concatenated name (not tainted initially).<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The <code>name_orig</code> parameter is tainted as it is derived from the previous function&#x27;s context, specifically from the <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code> string or any other tainted data that may have been passed through the call chain.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - The <code>name_orig</code> parameter is tainted upon entry into <code>get_named_object_name</code>. The <code>name</code> buffer is not tainted initially, but it will be populated with data derived from <code>name_orig</code>.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function first checks if the combined size of <code>name_orig</code> and the prefix (<code>named_value_prefix</code>) exceeds the maximum allowed length (<code>TEE_OBJECT_ID_MAX_LEN</code>). If it does, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>, and no further taint propagation occurs.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - If the size check passes, the function uses <code>TEE_MemMove(name, named_value_prefix, pref_len)</code> to copy the prefix into the <code>name</code> buffer. This operation does not introduce any taint since <code>named_value_prefix</code> is a constant and not derived from tainted data.<br>   - The function then concatenates the provided object name by calling <code>TEE_MemMove(name + pref_len, name_orig, name_orig_size)</code>. Here, the tainted <code>name_orig</code> is copied into the <code>name</code> buffer, starting at the position after the prefix. This means that the <code>name</code> buffer now contains tainted data.<br><br>4. **Setting the Name Size**:<br>   - The function sets <code>*name_size</code> to the total size of the concatenated name (<code>name_orig_size + pref_len</code>). This operation does not affect taint propagation.<br><br>5. **Return Value**:<br>   - The function returns <code>TEE_SUCCESS</code>, indicating that the operation was successful. The <code>name</code> buffer now contains a concatenated string that includes tainted data.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>name_orig</code> parameter is tainted upon entry into <code>get_named_object_name</code>.<br>- The taint propagates through the function, particularly into the <code>name</code> buffer when <code>name_orig</code> is copied.<br>- The <code>name</code> buffer now contains tainted data after the function completes, which may be used in subsequent operations.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis of <code>get_named_object_name</code> shows that the function effectively propagates tainted data from the <code>name_orig</code> parameter into the <code>name</code> buffer. The taint remains throughout the function, and the final state of the <code>name</code> buffer contains tainted data that may be used in later operations, such as in the <code>read_value</code> function. This represents a potential sink for tainted data, as any subsequent use of the <code>name</code> buffer could lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

To analyze the <code>TEE_MemMove</code> function in the context of taint data flow, we will consider how it interacts with the parameters that may be affected by tainted data. Since the implementation of <code>TEE_MemMove</code> is not provided, we will focus on its expected behavior based on typical memory copy operations and how it relates to the taint analysis results from the previous functions.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The <code>TEE_MemMove</code> function is typically used to copy a block of memory from one location to another. It is important to note that this function can handle overlapping memory regions, which is a key aspect of its behavior.<br><br>### Tainted Data Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Parameters Affected by Tainted Data**:<br>   - In the context of the previous functions, we have identified that the following parameters may be affected by tainted data:<br>     - <code>arg0</code>: This could represent the destination buffer where data is being copied to.<br>     - <code>arg1</code>: This could represent the source buffer from which data is being copied.<br>     - <code>arg2</code>: This could represent the size of the data being copied.<br><br>2. **Tracking Tainted Data**:<br>   - **Source Buffer (<code>arg1</code>)**:<br>     - In the previous analysis, we noted that <code>name_orig</code> (tainted) is copied into the <code>name</code> buffer using <code>TEE_MemMove(name + pref_len, name_orig, name_orig_size)</code>. Here, <code>name_orig</code> is the source buffer (<code>arg1</code>), which is tainted.<br>     - If <code>name_orig</code> contains tainted data, then any data copied from it into the destination buffer will also be tainted.<br><br>   - **Destination Buffer (<code>arg0</code>)**:<br>     - The destination buffer in the first call to <code>TEE_MemMove</code> is <code>name</code>, which is initially empty but will contain the prefix followed by the tainted data after the second call.<br>     - After the second call to <code>TEE_MemMove</code>, the <code>name</code> buffer will contain a concatenated string that includes both the prefix and the tainted data from <code>name_orig</code>.<br><br>   - **Size of Data (<code>arg2</code>)**:<br>     - The size parameter in both calls to <code>TEE_MemMove</code> is derived from the lengths of the respective buffers being copied. In the first call, it is <code>pref_len</code>, and in the second call, it is <code>name_orig_size</code>.<br>     - The size parameter itself is not tainted, but it determines how much data is copied from the source to the destination.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - When <code>TEE_MemMove</code> is called with tainted data as the source buffer, the destination buffer will also become tainted after the operation.<br>   - In the context of the <code>get_named_object_name</code> function, after the execution of both <code>TEE_MemMove</code> calls, the <code>name</code> buffer will contain tainted data, which can be used in subsequent operations (e.g., in <code>read_value</code>).<br><br>4. **Potential Sinks**:<br>   - The <code>name</code> buffer, now containing tainted data, will be passed to the <code>read_value</code> function. This represents a potential sink for tainted data, as any operations performed on this buffer could lead to security vulnerabilities if the tainted data is not properly validated or sanitized.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>TEE_MemMove</code> function is critical in propagating tainted data from the source buffer (<code>name_orig</code>) to the destination buffer (<code>name</code>).<br>- The taint flows through the memory copy operations, ensuring that any tainted data in the source buffer affects the destination buffer.<br>- The final state of the <code>name</code> buffer contains tainted data, which may be used in subsequent operations, particularly in the <code>read_value</code> function.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the analysis of <code>TEE_MemMove</code> highlights its role in propagating tainted data through memory operations. The function&#x27;s behavior ensures that any tainted data in the source buffer will affect the destination buffer, which can lead to potential security risks if the tainted data is not handled appropriately in subsequent operations. The tracking of tainted data through these memory operations is crucial for understanding the overall security implications of the code.

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes the following parameters:
- `void *sess`: Unused session parameter.
- `uint32_t cmd`: Command identifier.
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters that can be tainted.

### Tainted Parameters
- The parameters `pt` and `params` are considered tainted. The `params` array is particularly important as it can contain multiple values that may be influenced by external input.

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - `params` is tainted as it is directly passed to the function and can contain user-controlled data.
   - `cmd` is not tainted initially, but it is derived from user input.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of `cmd`.
   - The value of `cmd` is critical as it determines which function will be called next. This introduces an implicit flow since the execution path depends on the value of `cmd`.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `read_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - `params` is tainted and passed directly to this function, propagating the taint.
     - `pt` is not tainted, but it is passed as a parameter. If `read_persist_value` uses `pt` to index or manipulate `params`, it could indirectly affect the taint status.
   
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `write_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Similar to the previous case, `params` remains tainted as it is passed directly.
     - Again, `pt` is not tainted, but its use in the function could affect the taint status of `params`.

   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `delete_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - `params` is tainted and passed directly, propagating the taint.
     - The same considerations for `pt` apply here.

4. **Default Case**:
   - If `cmd` does not match any of the defined cases, an error message is logged, and `TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` is returned.
   - No taint propagation occurs in this case since no operations on `params` are performed.

### Data Aliases
- The `params` array is a pointer to `TEE_Param` structures. If any of these structures are modified within the called functions (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`), the taint can propagate through those modifications.
- If any of the functions modify the contents of `params`, the taint will persist in those modifications.

### Operations Propagating Taint
- The direct passing of `params` to the three command functions (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`) propagates the taint.
- Any modifications to `params` within those functions will maintain the taint.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The taint originates from the `params` parameter and is propagated through the function calls based on the value of `cmd`.
- The control flow (the `switch` statement) introduces implicit data flow, as the execution path depends on the user-controlled `cmd`.
- The `params` array remains tainted throughout the function, and any modifications to it in the called functions will continue to carry the taint.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function effectively propagates taint from the `params` parameter through its control flow and function calls. Care should be taken in the implementation of the called functions to ensure that they handle the tainted data appropriately.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: write_persist_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `write_persist_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `write_persist_value` takes the following parameters:
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters, where `params[0]` and `params[1]` are expected to be memory references containing user-controlled data.

### Tainted Input
- The `params` array is tainted as it is passed from the previous function. Specifically, `params[0]` and `params[1]` are of interest since they are used to store the name and value to be written.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `params` array is tainted, and we will focus on `params[0]` and `params[1]`.
   - `params[0].memref.buffer` and `params[1].memref.buffer` are pointers to user-controlled memory, making them tainted.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function first checks if `pt` matches the expected parameter type (`exp_pt`). If it does not match, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`, and no taint propagation occurs.
   - If the check passes, the function continues to process the tainted data.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - **Name Buffer**:
     - `name_buf` is assigned the value of `params[0].memref.buffer`, which is tainted.
     - `name_buf_sz` is assigned the size of `params[0].memref.size`, which is not tainted but is derived from the tainted input.
   - The function then calls `check_valid_value(name_buf)`, which uses the tainted `name_buf`. If this function returns an error, it logs an error message and returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`. This is an implicit flow where the taint affects the control flow.
   - The `overwrite` flag is set based on checks against `name_buf`, which is tainted. If the checks fail, it prevents further operations on the tainted data.

4. **Value Buffer**:
   - `value_sz` is assigned the size of `params[1].memref.size`, which is not tainted but is derived from the tainted input.
   - `value` is allocated memory using `TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)`. If the allocation fails, it returns `TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`, and no taint propagation occurs.
   - The function then uses `TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz);` to copy the contents of the tainted `params[1].memref.buffer` into the newly allocated `value`. This operation propagates the taint from `params[1]` to `value`.

5. **Conditional Logic**:
   - The function checks the `name_buf` against certain conditions (e.g., vendor prefix and rollback protection). If the conditions are met, it sets the `res` variable to `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS` and logs an error message. This is another implicit flow where the taint affects the control flow.
   - If the conditions are not met, the function calls `write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite);` or `increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz);`. Both of these functions will receive tainted data (`name_buf` and `value`).

6. **Memory Cleanup**:
   - The allocated `value` is freed using `TEE_Free(value);`, which does not affect the taint status but is important for memory management.

### Sinks
- The potential sinks in this function are:
  - The calls to `write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware`, which may perform operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities if they do not properly validate or sanitize the tainted inputs.
  - The logging of error messages with `name_buf` in `EMSG(&quot;Not found %s&quot;, name_buf);` could expose sensitive information if `name_buf` contains user-controlled data.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The taint originates from the `params` parameter and is propagated through the function:
  - `params[0].memref.buffer` is assigned to `name_buf`, which is tainted.
  - `params[1].memref.buffer` is copied to `value`, which is also tainted.
- The function checks the validity of the tainted data and may alter control flow based on its content.
- The tainted data reaches potential sinks in the form of function calls that may write or process the tainted data.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `write_persist_value` function effectively propagates taint from the `params` parameter through its control flow and function calls. Care should be taken in the implementation of the called functions (`write_value`, `increase_boot_firmware`) to ensure that they handle the tainted data appropriately and do not introduce vulnerabilities.</pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: increase_boot_firmware</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `increase_boot_firmware` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `new_ver_str` (which comes from the previous function `write_persist_value`) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `increase_boot_firmware` takes the following parameters:
- `char *new_ver_str`: A pointer to a string representing the new firmware version, which is tainted as it comes from user-controlled input.
- `uint32_t new_ver_sz`: The size of the new version string, which is not tainted but is derived from the tainted input.

### Tainted Input
- The `new_ver_str` parameter is tainted as it is passed from the previous function (`write_persist_value`), where it was copied from `params[1].memref.buffer`.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - `new_ver_str` is tainted as it is derived from user-controlled data.
   - `new_ver_sz` is not tainted but is based on the size of the tainted input.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function first checks if the system is rollback protected by calling `is_rollback_protected()`. This function does not affect the taint status but determines whether the subsequent checks will be executed.
   - If rollback protection is enabled, it checks if the new version string is incremental by calling `is_version_incremental(new_ver_str, new_ver_sz)`. This function uses the tainted `new_ver_str`, which introduces an implicit flow since the outcome of this check depends on user-controlled data.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - If the `is_version_incremental` function returns `false`, the function logs an error message using `EMSG(&quot;Boot firmware version update is not permitted&quot;);` and returns `TEE_ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`. This is an implicit flow where the taint affects the control flow, but no further taint propagation occurs in this case.
   - If the checks pass, the function proceeds to call `write_value(BOOTFIRM_VER, strlen(BOOTFIRM_VER) + 1, new_ver_str, new_ver_sz, true);`. Here, `new_ver_str` is tainted and is passed to `write_value`, propagating the taint.

4. **Sinks**:
   - The potential sink in this function is the call to `write_value`, which may perform operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities if it does not properly validate or sanitize the tainted input.
   - The logging of the error message with `new_ver_str` in `EMSG` could expose sensitive information if `new_ver_str` contains user-controlled data.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The taint originates from the `new_ver_str` parameter, which is passed from the previous function (`write_persist_value`).
- The function checks the validity of the tainted data and may alter control flow based on its content.
- The tainted data reaches a potential sink in the form of a function call to `write_value`, which may write or process the tainted data.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `increase_boot_firmware` function effectively propagates taint from the `new_ver_str` parameter through its control flow and function calls. Care should be taken in the implementation of the `write_value` function to ensure that it handles the tainted data appropriately and does not introduce vulnerabilities. The function also includes a logging mechanism that could expose sensitive information if not handled correctly.</pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: write_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `write_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted inputs `name` and `value` (which come from the previous function `increase_boot_firmware`) flow through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `write_value` takes the following parameters:
- `char *name`: A pointer to a string representing the name of the object to be written, which is tainted as it comes from user-controlled input.
- `uint32_t name_sz`: The size of the name string, which is not tainted but is derived from the tainted input.
- `char *value`: A pointer to a string representing the value to be written, which is also tainted as it comes from user-controlled input.
- `uint32_t value_sz`: The size of the value string, which is not tainted but is derived from the tainted input.
- `bool overwrite`: A flag indicating whether to overwrite the existing object.

### Tainted Input
- Both `name` and `value` are tainted as they are passed from the previous function (`increase_boot_firmware`), where they were derived from user-controlled data.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - `name` is tainted as it is derived from user-controlled data.
   - `value` is tainted as it is also derived from user-controlled data.
   - `name_sz` and `value_sz` are not tainted but are based on the sizes of the tainted inputs.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function begins by initializing a `TEE_ObjectHandle` and a `TEE_Result` variable.
   - The `flags` variable is set based on the `overwrite` parameter. If `overwrite` is true, additional flags are added, but this does not affect the taint status.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The function calls `get_named_object_name(name, name_sz, name_full, &amp;name_full_sz)`. This function uses the tainted `name` and `name_sz` to generate a full object name, which is stored in `name_full`. If `get_named_object_name` returns an error, the function exits early, and no further taint propagation occurs.
   - If the call to `get_named_object_name` is successful, the function then calls `TEE_CreatePersistentObject(storageid, name_full, name_full_sz, flags, NULL, value, value_sz, &amp;h)`. Here, both `value` and `value_sz` are tainted and are passed to this function, propagating the taint.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` returns `TEE_ERROR_ACCESS_CONFLICT`, an error message is logged using `EMSG(&quot;Can&#x27;t update named object &#x27;%s&#x27; value, res = 0x%x&quot;, name, res);`. This logging uses the tainted `name`, which could expose sensitive information if it contains user-controlled data.
   - If any other error occurs, a different error message is logged using `EMSG(&quot;Can&#x27;t create named object &#x27;%s&#x27; value, res = 0x%x&quot;, name, res);`, again using the tainted `name`.

5. **Closing the Object**:
   - The function calls `TEE_CloseObject(h);` to close the object handle. This does not affect the taint status but is important for resource management.

### Sinks
- The potential sinks in this function are:
  - The calls to `get_named_object_name` and `TEE_CreatePersistentObject`, which may perform operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities if they do not properly validate or sanitize the tainted inputs.
  - The logging of error messages with `name` in `EMSG` could expose sensitive information if `name` contains user-controlled data.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The taint originates from the `name` and `value` parameters, which are passed from the previous function (`increase_boot_firmware`).
- The function checks the validity of the tainted data and may alter control flow based on its content.
- The tainted data reaches potential sinks in the form of function calls that may write or process the tainted data.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `write_value` function effectively propagates taint from the `name` and `value` parameters through its control flow and function calls. Care should be taken in the implementation of the `get_named_object_name` and `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` functions to ensure that they handle the tainted data appropriately and do not introduce vulnerabilities. The function also includes logging mechanisms that could expose sensitive information if not handled correctly.</pre>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` function in the context of taint data flow, we will focus on how tainted data from the previous function (`write_value`) could affect its parameters. Since the implementation of `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` is unavailable, we will analyze the potential impact of tainted data based on the parameters passed to it and the implications of those parameters.

### Function Overview
The `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` function is called with the following parameters:
- `storageid`: An identifier for the storage location (not tainted in this context).
- `name_full`: A buffer containing the full name of the object to be created (potentially tainted).
- `name_full_sz`: The size of the `name_full` buffer (not tainted).
- `flags`: Flags that determine the access permissions and behavior of the object (not tainted).
- `NULL`: A pointer to the object attributes (not tainted in this context).
- `value`: A buffer containing the value to be written (tainted).
- `value_sz`: The size of the `value` buffer (not tainted).
- `&amp;h`: A pointer to a handle that will be populated with the created object&#x27;s handle (not tainted).

### Tainted Input
From the previous function (`write_value`), the following parameters are tainted:
- `name`: This is passed to `get_named_object_name`, which generates `name_full`. If `name` is tainted, then `name_full` could also be tainted depending on how `get_named_object_name` processes it.
- `value`: This is directly passed to `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` and is tainted.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Tainted Parameters**:
   - **`name_full`**: If the `get_named_object_name` function processes the tainted `name` in a way that does not sanitize or validate it, `name_full` could be tainted. This could lead to vulnerabilities if `name_full` is used in any way that exposes it to external systems or logs.
   - **`value`**: This parameter is directly tainted as it is passed from the previous function. Any operations performed on this value within `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` could lead to security issues if the value is not properly validated.

2. **Potential Data Aliases**:
   - If `name_full` is a pointer to a buffer that is manipulated within `TEE_CreatePersistentObject`, any modifications to this buffer could affect the taint status. For example, if `name_full` is used to create a file or object name in a filesystem, and it contains user-controlled data, it could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities or unauthorized access.
   - The `value` parameter is also a pointer to a buffer that may be written to persistent storage. If this buffer contains sensitive information and is not properly handled, it could lead to data leakage or corruption.

3. **Operations on Tainted Data**:
   - The operations performed within `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` on `name_full` and `value` are critical. If the function performs any checks or manipulations that rely on the integrity of these parameters, the presence of tainted data could lead to unintended consequences.
   - For example, if `value` is written to a persistent storage location without validation, it could overwrite existing data or create a new object with malicious content.

4. **Sinks**:
   - The potential sinks in this function are the operations that create or modify persistent objects based on the tainted `name_full` and `value`. If these operations do not properly validate the inputs, they could lead to security vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access, data corruption, or exposure of sensitive information.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The taint originates from the `name` and `value` parameters in the `write_value` function and is propagated to `name_full` and `value` in the `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` function.
- The potential for data aliasing exists if `name_full` is manipulated in a way that exposes it to external systems or logs.
- The operations on tainted data within `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` could lead to significant security risks if not handled properly.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` function is a critical point in the taint analysis, as it processes potentially tainted data from the `write_value` function. Care should be taken to ensure that both `name_full` and `value` are properly validated and sanitized before any operations are performed on them. The lack of visibility into the implementation of `TEE_CreatePersistentObject` necessitates a cautious approach to ensure that it does not introduce vulnerabilities based on tainted inputs.</pre>

To analyze the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>void *sess</code>: Unused session parameter.<br>- <code>uint32_t cmd</code>: Command identifier.<br>- <code>uint32_t pt</code>: Parameter type.<br>- <code>TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]</code>: Array of parameters that can be tainted.<br><br>### Tainted Parameters<br>- The parameters <code>pt</code> and <code>params</code> are considered tainted. The <code>params</code> array is particularly important as it can contain multiple values that may be influenced by external input.<br><br>### Data Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - <code>params</code> is tainted as it is directly passed to the function and can contain user-controlled data.<br>   - <code>cmd</code> is not tainted initially, but it is derived from user input.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function uses a <code>switch</code> statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of <code>cmd</code>.<br>   - The value of <code>cmd</code> is critical as it determines which function will be called next. This introduces an implicit flow since the execution path depends on the value of <code>cmd</code>.<br><br>3. **Case Analysis**:<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>read_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - <code>params</code> is tainted and passed directly to this function, propagating the taint.<br>     - <code>pt</code> is not tainted, but it is passed as a parameter. If <code>read_persist_value</code> uses <code>pt</code> to index or manipulate <code>params</code>, it could indirectly affect the taint status.<br>   <br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>write_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Similar to the previous case, <code>params</code> remains tainted as it is passed directly.<br>     - Again, <code>pt</code> is not tainted, but its use in the function could affect the taint status of <code>params</code>.<br><br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>delete_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - <code>params</code> is tainted and passed directly, propagating the taint.<br>     - The same considerations for <code>pt</code> apply here.<br><br>4. **Default Case**:<br>   - If <code>cmd</code> does not match any of the defined cases, an error message is logged, and <code>TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED</code> is returned.<br>   - No taint propagation occurs in this case since no operations on <code>params</code> are performed.<br><br>### Data Aliases<br>- The <code>params</code> array is a pointer to <code>TEE_Param</code> structures. If any of these structures are modified within the called functions (<code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, <code>delete_persist_value</code>), the taint can propagate through those modifications.<br>- If any of the functions modify the contents of <code>params</code>, the taint will persist in those modifications.<br><br>### Operations Propagating Taint<br>- The direct passing of <code>params</code> to the three command functions (<code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, <code>delete_persist_value</code>) propagates the taint.<br>- Any modifications to <code>params</code> within those functions will maintain the taint.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Propagation<br>- The taint originates from the <code>params</code> parameter and is propagated through the function calls based on the value of <code>cmd</code>.<br>- The control flow (the <code>switch</code> statement) introduces implicit data flow, as the execution path depends on the user-controlled <code>cmd</code>.<br>- The <code>params</code> array remains tainted throughout the function, and any modifications to it in the called functions will continue to carry the taint.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function effectively propagates taint from the <code>params</code> parameter through its control flow and function calls. Care should be taken in the implementation of the called functions to ensure that they handle the tainted data appropriately.

To analyze the <code>write_persist_value</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>params</code> (from the previous function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>write_persist_value</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>uint32_t pt</code>: Parameter type.<br>- <code>TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]</code>: Array of parameters, where <code>params[0]</code> and <code>params[1]</code> are expected to be memory references containing user-controlled data.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The <code>params</code> array is tainted as it is passed from the previous function. Specifically, <code>params[0]</code> and <code>params[1]</code> are of interest since they are used to store the name and value to be written.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - The <code>params</code> array is tainted, and we will focus on <code>params[0]</code> and <code>params[1]</code>.<br>   - <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> and <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> are pointers to user-controlled memory, making them tainted.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function first checks if <code>pt</code> matches the expected parameter type (<code>exp_pt</code>). If it does not match, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>, and no taint propagation occurs.<br>   - If the check passes, the function continues to process the tainted data.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - **Name Buffer**:<br>     - <code>name_buf</code> is assigned the value of <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code>, which is tainted.<br>     - <code>name_buf_sz</code> is assigned the size of <code>params[0].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted but is derived from the tainted input.<br>   - The function then calls <code>check_valid_value(name_buf)</code>, which uses the tainted <code>name_buf</code>. If this function returns an error, it logs an error message and returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>. This is an implicit flow where the taint affects the control flow.<br>   - The <code>overwrite</code> flag is set based on checks against <code>name_buf</code>, which is tainted. If the checks fail, it prevents further operations on the tainted data.<br><br>4. **Value Buffer**:<br>   - <code>value_sz</code> is assigned the size of <code>params[1].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted but is derived from the tainted input.<br>   - <code>value</code> is allocated memory using <code>TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)</code>. If the allocation fails, it returns <code>TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY</code>, and no taint propagation occurs.<br>   - The function then uses <code>TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz);</code> to copy the contents of the tainted <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> into the newly allocated <code>value</code>. This operation propagates the taint from <code>params[1]</code> to <code>value</code>.<br><br>5. **Conditional Logic**:<br>   - The function checks the <code>name_buf</code> against certain conditions (e.g., vendor prefix and rollback protection). If the conditions are met, it sets the <code>res</code> variable to <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code> and logs an error message. This is another implicit flow where the taint affects the control flow.<br>   - If the conditions are not met, the function calls <code>write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite);</code> or <code>increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz);</code>. Both of these functions will receive tainted data (<code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code>).<br><br>6. **Memory Cleanup**:<br>   - The allocated <code>value</code> is freed using <code>TEE_Free(value);</code>, which does not affect the taint status but is important for memory management.<br><br>### Sinks<br>- The potential sinks in this function are:<br>  - The calls to <code>write_value</code> and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>, which may perform operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities if they do not properly validate or sanitize the tainted inputs.<br>  - The logging of error messages with <code>name_buf</code> in <code>EMSG(&quot;Not found %s&quot;, name_buf);</code> could expose sensitive information if <code>name_buf</code> contains user-controlled data.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Propagation<br>- The taint originates from the <code>params</code> parameter and is propagated through the function:<br>  - <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> is assigned to <code>name_buf</code>, which is tainted.<br>  - <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> is copied to <code>value</code>, which is also tainted.<br>- The function checks the validity of the tainted data and may alter control flow based on its content.<br>- The tainted data reaches potential sinks in the form of function calls that may write or process the tainted data.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the <code>write_persist_value</code> function effectively propagates taint from the <code>params</code> parameter through its control flow and function calls. Care should be taken in the implementation of the called functions (<code>write_value</code>, <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>) to ensure that they handle the tainted data appropriately and do not introduce vulnerabilities.

To analyze the <code>write_value</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted inputs <code>name</code> and <code>value</code> (which come from the previous function <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>) flow through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>write_value</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>char *name</code>: A pointer to a string representing the name of the object to be written, which is tainted as it comes from user-controlled input.<br>- <code>uint32_t name_sz</code>: The size of the name string, which is not tainted but is derived from the tainted input.<br>- <code>char *value</code>: A pointer to a string representing the value to be written, which is also tainted as it comes from user-controlled input.<br>- <code>uint32_t value_sz</code>: The size of the value string, which is not tainted but is derived from the tainted input.<br>- <code>bool overwrite</code>: A flag indicating whether to overwrite the existing object.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- Both <code>name</code> and <code>value</code> are tainted as they are passed from the previous function (<code>increase_boot_firmware</code>), where they were derived from user-controlled data.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - <code>name</code> is tainted as it is derived from user-controlled data.<br>   - <code>value</code> is tainted as it is also derived from user-controlled data.<br>   - <code>name_sz</code> and <code>value_sz</code> are not tainted but are based on the sizes of the tainted inputs.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function begins by initializing a <code>TEE_ObjectHandle</code> and a <code>TEE_Result</code> variable.<br>   - The <code>flags</code> variable is set based on the <code>overwrite</code> parameter. If <code>overwrite</code> is true, additional flags are added, but this does not affect the taint status.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - The function calls <code>get_named_object_name(name, name_sz, name_full, &amp;name_full_sz)</code>. This function uses the tainted <code>name</code> and <code>name_sz</code> to generate a full object name, which is stored in <code>name_full</code>. If <code>get_named_object_name</code> returns an error, the function exits early, and no further taint propagation occurs.<br>   - If the call to <code>get_named_object_name</code> is successful, the function then calls <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject(storageid, name_full, name_full_sz, flags, NULL, value, value_sz, &amp;h)</code>. Here, both <code>value</code> and <code>value_sz</code> are tainted and are passed to this function, propagating the taint.<br><br>4. **Error Handling**:<br>   - If <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code> returns <code>TEE_ERROR_ACCESS_CONFLICT</code>, an error message is logged using <code>EMSG(&quot;Can&#x27;t update named object &#x27;%s&#x27; value, res = 0x%x&quot;, name, res);</code>. This logging uses the tainted <code>name</code>, which could expose sensitive information if it contains user-controlled data.<br>   - If any other error occurs, a different error message is logged using <code>EMSG(&quot;Can&#x27;t create named object &#x27;%s&#x27; value, res = 0x%x&quot;, name, res);</code>, again using the tainted <code>name</code>.<br><br>5. **Closing the Object**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_CloseObject(h);</code> to close the object handle. This does not affect the taint status but is important for resource management.<br><br>### Sinks<br>- The potential sinks in this function are:<br>  - The calls to <code>get_named_object_name</code> and <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code>, which may perform operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities if they do not properly validate or sanitize the tainted inputs.<br>  - The logging of error messages with <code>name</code> in <code>EMSG</code> could expose sensitive information if <code>name</code> contains user-controlled data.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Propagation<br>- The taint originates from the <code>name</code> and <code>value</code> parameters, which are passed from the previous function (<code>increase_boot_firmware</code>).<br>- The function checks the validity of the tainted data and may alter control flow based on its content.<br>- The tainted data reaches potential sinks in the form of function calls that may write or process the tainted data.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the <code>write_value</code> function effectively propagates taint from the <code>name</code> and <code>value</code> parameters through its control flow and function calls. Care should be taken in the implementation of the <code>get_named_object_name</code> and <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code> functions to ensure that they handle the tainted data appropriately and do not introduce vulnerabilities. The function also includes logging mechanisms that could expose sensitive information if not handled correctly.

To analyze the <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code> function in the context of taint data flow, we will focus on how tainted data from the previous function (<code>write_value</code>) could affect its parameters. Since the implementation of <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code> is unavailable, we will analyze the potential impact of tainted data based on the parameters passed to it and the implications of those parameters.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code> function is called with the following parameters:<br>- <code>storageid</code>: An identifier for the storage location (not tainted in this context).<br>- <code>name_full</code>: A buffer containing the full name of the object to be created (potentially tainted).<br>- <code>name_full_sz</code>: The size of the <code>name_full</code> buffer (not tainted).<br>- <code>flags</code>: Flags that determine the access permissions and behavior of the object (not tainted).<br>- <code>NULL</code>: A pointer to the object attributes (not tainted in this context).<br>- <code>value</code>: A buffer containing the value to be written (tainted).<br>- <code>value_sz</code>: The size of the <code>value</code> buffer (not tainted).<br>- <code>&amp;h</code>: A pointer to a handle that will be populated with the created object&#x27;s handle (not tainted).<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>From the previous function (<code>write_value</code>), the following parameters are tainted:<br>- <code>name</code>: This is passed to <code>get_named_object_name</code>, which generates <code>name_full</code>. If <code>name</code> is tainted, then <code>name_full</code> could also be tainted depending on how <code>get_named_object_name</code> processes it.<br>- <code>value</code>: This is directly passed to <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code> and is tainted.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - **<code>name_full</code>**: If the <code>get_named_object_name</code> function processes the tainted <code>name</code> in a way that does not sanitize or validate it, <code>name_full</code> could be tainted. This could lead to vulnerabilities if <code>name_full</code> is used in any way that exposes it to external systems or logs.<br>   - **<code>value</code>**: This parameter is directly tainted as it is passed from the previous function. Any operations performed on this value within <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code> could lead to security issues if the value is not properly validated.<br><br>2. **Potential Data Aliases**:<br>   - If <code>name_full</code> is a pointer to a buffer that is manipulated within <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code>, any modifications to this buffer could affect the taint status. For example, if <code>name_full</code> is used to create a file or object name in a filesystem, and it contains user-controlled data, it could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities or unauthorized access.<br>   - The <code>value</code> parameter is also a pointer to a buffer that may be written to persistent storage. If this buffer contains sensitive information and is not properly handled, it could lead to data leakage or corruption.<br><br>3. **Operations on Tainted Data**:<br>   - The operations performed within <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code> on <code>name_full</code> and <code>value</code> are critical. If the function performs any checks or manipulations that rely on the integrity of these parameters, the presence of tainted data could lead to unintended consequences.<br>   - For example, if <code>value</code> is written to a persistent storage location without validation, it could overwrite existing data or create a new object with malicious content.<br><br>4. **Sinks**:<br>   - The potential sinks in this function are the operations that create or modify persistent objects based on the tainted <code>name_full</code> and <code>value</code>. If these operations do not properly validate the inputs, they could lead to security vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access, data corruption, or exposure of sensitive information.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Propagation<br>- The taint originates from the <code>name</code> and <code>value</code> parameters in the <code>write_value</code> function and is propagated to <code>name_full</code> and <code>value</code> in the <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code> function.<br>- The potential for data aliasing exists if <code>name_full</code> is manipulated in a way that exposes it to external systems or logs.<br>- The operations on tainted data within <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code> could lead to significant security risks if not handled properly.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code> function is a critical point in the taint analysis, as it processes potentially tainted data from the <code>write_value</code> function. Care should be taken to ensure that both <code>name_full</code> and <code>value</code> are properly validated and sanitized before any operations are performed on them. The lack of visibility into the implementation of <code>TEE_CreatePersistentObject</code> necessitates a cautious approach to ensure that it does not introduce vulnerabilities based on tainted inputs.

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes the following parameters:
- `void *sess`: Unused session parameter.
- `uint32_t cmd`: Command identifier.
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters.

The function uses a switch statement to handle different command IDs, calling different functions based on the command.

### Tainted Parameters
- **Tainted Parameters**: `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` are considered tainted. In this context, we assume that the `params` array can contain user-controlled data.

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - `params` is tainted upon entry to the function.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The `cmd` parameter determines which case in the switch statement is executed. The taint from `params` will propagate to the called functions based on the value of `cmd`.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `read_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Taint from `params` is passed to `read_persist_value`. If `read_persist_value` uses `params`, it will be tainted.
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `write_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Taint from `params` is passed to `write_persist_value`. If `write_persist_value` uses `params`, it will be tainted.
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `delete_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Taint from `params` is passed to `delete_persist_value`. If `delete_persist_value` uses `params`, it will be tainted.
   - **Default Case**:
     - Logs an error message but does not propagate taint since it does not call any function that uses `params`.

4. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `params` array is passed by reference to the functions `read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, and `delete_persist_value`. This means that any modifications to `params` within these functions will affect the original `params` array, maintaining the taint.

5. **Operations Propagating Taint**:
   - The switch statement itself does not create new variables, but it directs the flow of tainted data to the respective functions.
   - If any of the called functions (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`) perform operations that modify or utilize `params`, the taint will propagate through those operations.

6. **Implicit Flow**:
   - The control flow based on the value of `cmd` creates an implicit flow. If `cmd` is controlled by an external input, it can determine which function is called, thus controlling whether tainted data is processed or not.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The `params` array is tainted upon entry to `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`.
- The taint propagates to the functions `read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, and `delete_persist_value` based on the value of `cmd`.
- Any modifications to `params` within these functions will maintain the taint.
- The default case does not propagate taint but logs an error.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the taint analysis shows that the `params` parameter is the primary source of taint in the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function. The taint propagates through the function based on the command executed, and any modifications to `params` in the called functions will retain the taint. Care should be taken in the implementation of these functions to ensure that tainted data is handled securely.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: write_persist_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `write_persist_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `write_persist_value` takes the following parameters:
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters, which is tainted.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: The `params` array is tainted, specifically `params[0]` and `params[1]`, which are expected to be memory references containing user-controlled data.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `params` array is tainted upon entry to `write_persist_value`.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   - The function checks if `pt` matches the expected parameter types (`exp_pt`). If it does not match, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`, and no further taint propagation occurs.

3. **Buffer Assignments**:
   - `name_buf` is assigned from `params[0].memref.buffer`, which is tainted. Therefore, `name_buf` is also tainted.
   - `name_buf_sz` is assigned from `params[0].memref.size`, which is not tainted but is derived from a tainted parameter.

4. **Validation Check**:
   - The function calls `check_valid_value(name_buf)`. If this function uses `name_buf`, it will be operating on tainted data. If it returns `TEE_SUCCESS`, the flow continues; otherwise, it logs an error and returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`.

5. **Overwrite Check**:
   - The function checks if `name_buf` starts with a specific vendor prefix or the `ROLLBACK_PROT` string. If it does, the `overwrite` flag is set to `false`. This check does not propagate taint but controls the flow based on the tainted data.

6. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `value_sz` is assigned from `params[1].memref.size`, which is also derived from a tainted parameter.
   - `value` is allocated using `TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)`. If the allocation fails, it returns `TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`, and no taint propagation occurs.

7. **Data Movement**:
   - The function uses `TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)`. Here, `params[1].memref.buffer` is tainted, and thus `value` becomes tainted as it copies data from a tainted source.

8. **Conditional Logic**:
   - The function checks if `name_buf` starts with the vendor prefix and whether `CFG_FIOVB_VENDOR_CREATE` is enabled. If not, it logs an error and sets `res` to `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`. This does not propagate taint but controls the flow based on tainted data.
   - If `name_buf` does not match `BOOTFIRM_VER`, it calls `write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite)`. Here, both `name_buf` and `value` are tainted, so the call to `write_value` operates on tainted data.
   - If `name_buf` matches `BOOTFIRM_VER`, it calls `increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz)`, which also operates on tainted data.

9. **Memory Deallocation**:
   - The function calls `TEE_Free(value)`, which does not affect taint but cleans up allocated memory.

10. **Return Value**:
    - The function returns `res`, which may indicate success or failure based on the operations performed. If any of the operations used tainted data, the result may be influenced by that taint.

### Taint Propagation Summary
- The taint from `params[0]` and `params[1]` propagates to `name_buf` and `value`, respectively.
- The function performs operations on tainted data, specifically in the calls to `write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware`, which are potential sinks for tainted data.
- The function does not sanitize or validate the contents of `name_buf` and `value` before using them in critical operations, which could lead to vulnerabilities if the data is malicious.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `write_persist_value` function propagates taint from the `params` array to local variables `name_buf` and `value`. It performs operations on this tainted data, potentially reaching sinks in the form of calls to `write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware`. Care should be taken to ensure that these functions handle tainted data securely to prevent vulnerabilities.</pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: increase_boot_firmware</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `increase_boot_firmware` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `new_ver_str` (which is derived from the previous function `write_persist_value`) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `increase_boot_firmware` takes the following parameters:
- `char *new_ver_str`: A pointer to a string representing the new firmware version, which is tainted.
- `uint32_t new_ver_sz`: The size of the new firmware version string.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: The `new_ver_str` parameter is tainted, as it is derived from the `value` variable in the `write_persist_value` function, which was populated from `params[1].memref.buffer`.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameter**:
   - The `new_ver_str` is tainted upon entry to `increase_boot_firmware`.

2. **Rollback Protection Check**:
   - The function calls `is_rollback_protected()`, which does not affect taint but checks a condition related to firmware updates.
   - The function then calls `is_version_incremental(new_ver_str, new_ver_sz)`. Since `new_ver_str` is tainted, this function operates on tainted data. If this function returns `false`, it indicates that the version update is not permitted, and the function logs an error message and returns `TEE_ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`. This does not propagate taint but controls the flow based on tainted data.

3. **Call to `write_value`**:
   - If the rollback protection check passes, the function calls `write_value(BOOTFIRM_VER, strlen(BOOTFIRM_VER) + 1, new_ver_str, new_ver_sz, true)`.
   - Here, `new_ver_str` is tainted, and it is passed as an argument to `write_value`. This means that the taint propagates to `write_value`, which is a potential sink for tainted data.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the result of the `write_value` call. If `write_value` processes tainted data, the result may be influenced by that taint.

### Taint Propagation Summary
- The taint from `new_ver_str` propagates through the function, particularly in the call to `is_version_incremental`, which operates on tainted data.
- The taint reaches a sink in the form of the call to `write_value`, which uses `new_ver_str` as an argument. This is a critical point where tainted data could lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `increase_boot_firmware` function propagates taint from the `new_ver_str` parameter, which is derived from the previous function. The taint is utilized in the call to `is_version_incremental` and reaches a sink in the call to `write_value`. It is essential to ensure that `write_value` handles this tainted data securely to prevent potential vulnerabilities in the firmware update process.</pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: is_rollback_protected</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `is_rollback_protected` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `is_rollback_protected` does not take any parameters. Instead, it checks if rollback protection is enabled by reading a value associated with `ROLLBACK_PROT`.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: There are no direct tainted inputs to this function from the previous function (`increase_boot_firmware`). However, the context of the taint analysis is that this function is called as part of a larger flow where tainted data is being processed.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Function Entry**:
   - The function does not receive any parameters, so there are no tainted inputs directly flowing into it.

2. **Reading Rollback Protection Value**:
   - The function calls `read_value(ROLLBACK_PROT, strlen(ROLLBACK_PROT) + 1, value, value_sz, &amp;count)`.
   - The `ROLLBACK_PROT` string is a constant and not tainted. However, the result of this function call is critical for determining whether rollback protection is enabled.
   - The `value` array is used to store the result of the `read_value` call, but it is not directly influenced by any tainted data from previous functions.

3. **Result Check**:
   - If `read_value` returns `TEE_SUCCESS`, the function logs a message indicating that rollback protection is enabled and returns `true`.
   - If `read_value` does not return `TEE_SUCCESS`, the function returns `false`.

### Taint Propagation Summary
- There is no propagation of taint from previous functions into `is_rollback_protected` since it does not take any parameters and operates on constant values.
- The function does not introduce any new taint, nor does it propagate any tainted data to sinks. It simply checks a condition based on the result of `read_value`.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `is_rollback_protected` function does not propagate any taint from previous functions, as it does not take any parameters and operates independently of the tainted data flow. It checks for rollback protection based on a constant value and the result of the `read_value` function. Since there are no tainted inputs or outputs, this function does not present a risk of taint-related vulnerabilities.</pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: read_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `read_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `read_value` takes the following parameters:
- `char *name`: A pointer to a string representing the name of the object to read.
- `uint32_t name_sz`: The size of the name string.
- `char *value`: A pointer to a buffer where the read value will be stored.
- `uint32_t value_sz`: The size of the buffer for the value.
- `uint32_t *count`: A pointer to a variable that will hold the number of bytes read.

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: The `name` parameter is tainted, as it is derived from the `ROLLBACK_PROT` constant in the context of the previous function calls. However, the actual content of `name` is not user-controlled; it is a constant string. The `value` buffer is where the function will write data, and it is also tainted in the context of the previous function calls.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `name` parameter is not tainted in the sense of user-controlled data, as it is a constant string (`ROLLBACK_PROT`). However, it is important to note that it is used to access potentially sensitive data.
   - The `value` parameter is a buffer that will receive data from the persistent storage, and it is tainted in the context of the previous function calls.

2. **Get Named Object Name**:
   - The function calls `get_named_object_name(name, name_sz, name_full, &amp;name_full_sz)`. The `name` parameter is not tainted, but the result of this function is critical for determining the object to read. If this function fails, it returns an error code, and no further processing occurs.

3. **Open Persistent Object**:
   - The function calls `TEE_OpenPersistentObject(storageid, name_full, name_full_sz, flags, &amp;h)`. This function attempts to open a persistent object based on the name derived from the previous step. If it fails, it logs an error and returns an error code. The `name_full` variable is not tainted since it is derived from a constant name.

4. **Read Object Data**:
   - The function calls `TEE_ReadObjectData(h, value, value_sz, count)`. Here, the `value` buffer is where the data is written. If the read operation is successful, the data written to `value` could be tainted if it is influenced by user-controlled data in the persistent storage.
   - If this operation fails, it logs an error message and returns an error code.

5. **Close Object**:
   - The function calls `TEE_CloseObject(h)` to close the persistent object handle. This does not affect taint but is a necessary cleanup step.

6. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the result of the read operation. If the read operation is successful, the `value` buffer will contain data that may or may not be tainted, depending on the contents of the persistent storage.

### Taint Propagation Summary
- The `name` parameter is not tainted, as it is a constant string. However, it is used to access potentially sensitive data.
- The `value` parameter is where data is written, and if the read operation is successful, it will contain data from persistent storage. The taint of this data depends on the contents of the storage, which may or may not be influenced by previous user-controlled inputs.
- The function does not introduce new taint but operates on potentially sensitive data, which could be tainted if the persistent storage contains user-controlled data.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `read_value` function does not propagate taint from user-controlled inputs, as the `name` parameter is a constant. However, it reads data into the `value` buffer, which could be tainted depending on the contents of the persistent storage. The function&#x27;s behavior is critical in determining whether tainted data reaches sinks in the application. Care should be taken to ensure that the data stored in persistent storage is validated and sanitized to prevent vulnerabilities.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_ReadObjectData</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_ReadObjectData` function in the context of taint data flow, we will focus on how tainted data could affect the parameters `arg0` and `arg2`, which correspond to the `value` and `value_sz` parameters in the `read_value` function. Since the implementation of `TEE_ReadObjectData` is unavailable, we will analyze the potential taint propagation based on the expected behavior of this function and the context provided.

### Function Overview
The `TEE_ReadObjectData` function is expected to read data from a persistent object into a buffer. The parameters are typically as follows:
- `arg0`: A pointer to the buffer where the data will be read (corresponds to `value` in `read_value`).
- `arg1`: The size of the buffer (corresponds to `value_sz` in `read_value`).
- `arg2`: A pointer to a variable that will hold the number of bytes read (corresponds to `count` in `read_value`).

### Tainted Input
- **Tainted Input**: The `value` buffer (arg0) is where the data will be written, and it is tainted in the context of the previous function calls. The `value_sz` parameter (arg1) is the size of the buffer, which is not tainted but is derived from the context of the function. The `count` parameter (arg2) is a pointer that will hold the number of bytes read, and it is also not tainted.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `value` buffer (arg0) is tainted because it is intended to receive data from persistent storage. If the data read from the storage is influenced by user-controlled inputs, the taint will propagate to this buffer.
   - The `value_sz` parameter (arg1) is not tainted, as it is a size value that is determined by the context of the function. However, it is crucial for ensuring that the read operation does not exceed the buffer size.
   - The `count` parameter (arg2) is a pointer to a variable that will hold the number of bytes read. This variable itself is not tainted, but it will be updated based on the read operation.

2. **Data Read Operation**:
   - The `TEE_ReadObjectData` function is expected to read data from the persistent object into the `value` buffer. The behavior of this function is critical in determining whether tainted data is written to `value`.
   - If the persistent storage contains user-controlled data, the data read into `value` will be tainted. This is a significant point of concern, as it could lead to vulnerabilities if the data is not properly validated or sanitized.

3. **Count Update**:
   - The `count` variable (arg2) will be updated to reflect the number of bytes read from the persistent object. If the read operation is successful, this count will indicate how much data was written to the `value` buffer.
   - While `count` itself is not tainted, it is important to note that it reflects the outcome of the read operation, which could involve tainted data.

### Data Aliases and Tainted Data Operations
- The `value` buffer (arg0) is a direct alias for the data that will be affected by the read operation. If the data read from the persistent storage is tainted, then `value` will also be tainted.
- The `count` variable (arg2) is indirectly affected by the tainted data operation, as it will indicate how many bytes of potentially tainted data were read into `value`.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `TEE_ReadObjectData` function is a critical point in the taint analysis, as it is responsible for reading data into the `value` buffer. If the persistent storage contains user-controlled data, the taint will propagate to `value`, making it potentially vulnerable. The `value_sz` parameter ensures that the read operation does not exceed the buffer size, while the `count` variable reflects the outcome of the read operation. It is essential to ensure that the data stored in persistent storage is validated and sanitized to prevent vulnerabilities associated with tainted data.</pre>

To analyze the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>void *sess</code>: Unused session parameter.<br>- <code>uint32_t cmd</code>: Command identifier.<br>- <code>uint32_t pt</code>: Parameter type.<br>- <code>TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]</code>: Array of parameters.<br><br>The function uses a switch statement to handle different command IDs, calling different functions based on the command.<br><br>### Tainted Parameters<br>- **Tainted Parameters**: <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> are considered tainted. In this context, we assume that the <code>params</code> array can contain user-controlled data.<br><br>### Data Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - <code>params</code> is tainted upon entry to the function.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The <code>cmd</code> parameter determines which case in the switch statement is executed. The taint from <code>params</code> will propagate to the called functions based on the value of <code>cmd</code>.<br><br>3. **Case Analysis**:<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>read_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Taint from <code>params</code> is passed to <code>read_persist_value</code>. If <code>read_persist_value</code> uses <code>params</code>, it will be tainted.<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>write_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Taint from <code>params</code> is passed to <code>write_persist_value</code>. If <code>write_persist_value</code> uses <code>params</code>, it will be tainted.<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>delete_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Taint from <code>params</code> is passed to <code>delete_persist_value</code>. If <code>delete_persist_value</code> uses <code>params</code>, it will be tainted.<br>   - **Default Case**:<br>     - Logs an error message but does not propagate taint since it does not call any function that uses <code>params</code>.<br><br>4. **Data Aliases**:<br>   - The <code>params</code> array is passed by reference to the functions <code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, and <code>delete_persist_value</code>. This means that any modifications to <code>params</code> within these functions will affect the original <code>params</code> array, maintaining the taint.<br><br>5. **Operations Propagating Taint**:<br>   - The switch statement itself does not create new variables, but it directs the flow of tainted data to the respective functions.<br>   - If any of the called functions (<code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, <code>delete_persist_value</code>) perform operations that modify or utilize <code>params</code>, the taint will propagate through those operations.<br><br>6. **Implicit Flow**:<br>   - The control flow based on the value of <code>cmd</code> creates an implicit flow. If <code>cmd</code> is controlled by an external input, it can determine which function is called, thus controlling whether tainted data is processed or not.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Propagation<br>- The <code>params</code> array is tainted upon entry to <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>.<br>- The taint propagates to the functions <code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, and <code>delete_persist_value</code> based on the value of <code>cmd</code>.<br>- Any modifications to <code>params</code> within these functions will maintain the taint.<br>- The default case does not propagate taint but logs an error.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis shows that the <code>params</code> parameter is the primary source of taint in the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function. The taint propagates through the function based on the command executed, and any modifications to <code>params</code> in the called functions will retain the taint. Care should be taken in the implementation of these functions to ensure that tainted data is handled securely.

To analyze the <code>write_persist_value</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>params</code> (from the previous function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>write_persist_value</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>uint32_t pt</code>: Parameter type.<br>- <code>TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]</code>: Array of parameters, which is tainted.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- **Tainted Input**: The <code>params</code> array is tainted, specifically <code>params[0]</code> and <code>params[1]</code>, which are expected to be memory references containing user-controlled data.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - The <code>params</code> array is tainted upon entry to <code>write_persist_value</code>.<br><br>2. **Parameter Type Check**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>pt</code> matches the expected parameter types (<code>exp_pt</code>). If it does not match, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>, and no further taint propagation occurs.<br><br>3. **Buffer Assignments**:<br>   - <code>name_buf</code> is assigned from <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code>, which is tainted. Therefore, <code>name_buf</code> is also tainted.<br>   - <code>name_buf_sz</code> is assigned from <code>params[0].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted but is derived from a tainted parameter.<br><br>4. **Validation Check**:<br>   - The function calls <code>check_valid_value(name_buf)</code>. If this function uses <code>name_buf</code>, it will be operating on tainted data. If it returns <code>TEE_SUCCESS</code>, the flow continues; otherwise, it logs an error and returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>.<br><br>5. **Overwrite Check**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with a specific vendor prefix or the <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code> string. If it does, the <code>overwrite</code> flag is set to <code>false</code>. This check does not propagate taint but controls the flow based on the tainted data.<br><br>6. **Memory Allocation**:<br>   - <code>value_sz</code> is assigned from <code>params[1].memref.size</code>, which is also derived from a tainted parameter.<br>   - <code>value</code> is allocated using <code>TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)</code>. If the allocation fails, it returns <code>TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY</code>, and no taint propagation occurs.<br><br>7. **Data Movement**:<br>   - The function uses <code>TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)</code>. Here, <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> is tainted, and thus <code>value</code> becomes tainted as it copies data from a tainted source.<br><br>8. **Conditional Logic**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with the vendor prefix and whether <code>CFG_FIOVB_VENDOR_CREATE</code> is enabled. If not, it logs an error and sets <code>res</code> to <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>. This does not propagate taint but controls the flow based on tainted data.<br>   - If <code>name_buf</code> does not match <code>BOOTFIRM_VER</code>, it calls <code>write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite)</code>. Here, both <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code> are tainted, so the call to <code>write_value</code> operates on tainted data.<br>   - If <code>name_buf</code> matches <code>BOOTFIRM_VER</code>, it calls <code>increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz)</code>, which also operates on tainted data.<br><br>9. **Memory Deallocation**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_Free(value)</code>, which does not affect taint but cleans up allocated memory.<br><br>10. **Return Value**:<br>    - The function returns <code>res</code>, which may indicate success or failure based on the operations performed. If any of the operations used tainted data, the result may be influenced by that taint.<br><br>### Taint Propagation Summary<br>- The taint from <code>params[0]</code> and <code>params[1]</code> propagates to <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code>, respectively.<br>- The function performs operations on tainted data, specifically in the calls to <code>write_value</code> and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>, which are potential sinks for tainted data.<br>- The function does not sanitize or validate the contents of <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code> before using them in critical operations, which could lead to vulnerabilities if the data is malicious.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the <code>write_persist_value</code> function propagates taint from the <code>params</code> array to local variables <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code>. It performs operations on this tainted data, potentially reaching sinks in the form of calls to <code>write_value</code> and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>. Care should be taken to ensure that these functions handle tainted data securely to prevent vulnerabilities.

Instead, it checks if rollback protection is enabled by reading a value associated with <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code>.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- **Tainted Input**: There are no direct tainted inputs to this function from the previous function (<code>increase_boot_firmware</code>). However, the context of the taint analysis is that this function is called as part of a larger flow where tainted data is being processed.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Function Entry**:<br>   - The function does not receive any parameters, so there are no tainted inputs directly flowing into it.<br><br>2. **Reading Rollback Protection Value**:<br>   - The function calls <code>read_value(ROLLBACK_PROT, strlen(ROLLBACK_PROT) + 1, value, value_sz, &amp;count)</code>.<br>   - The <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code> string is a constant and not tainted. However, the result of this function call is critical for determining whether rollback protection is enabled.<br>   - The <code>value</code> array is used to store the result of the <code>read_value</code> call, but it is not directly influenced by any tainted data from previous functions.<br><br>3. **Result Check**:<br>   - If <code>read_value</code> returns <code>TEE_SUCCESS</code>, the function logs a message indicating that rollback protection is enabled and returns <code>true</code>.<br>   - If <code>read_value</code> does not return <code>TEE_SUCCESS</code>, the function returns <code>false</code>.<br><br>### Taint Propagation Summary<br>- There is no propagation of taint from previous functions into <code>is_rollback_protected</code> since it does not take any parameters and operates on constant values.<br>- The function does not introduce any new taint, nor does it propagate any tainted data to sinks. It simply checks a condition based on the result of <code>read_value</code>.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the <code>is_rollback_protected</code> function does not propagate any taint from previous functions, as it does not take any parameters and operates independently of the tainted data flow. It checks for rollback protection based on a constant value and the result of the <code>read_value</code> function. Since there are no tainted inputs or outputs, this function does not present a risk of taint-related vulnerabilities.

However, it is important to note that it is used to access potentially sensitive data.<br>   - The <code>value</code> parameter is a buffer that will receive data from the persistent storage, and it is tainted in the context of the previous function calls.<br><br>2. **Get Named Object Name**:<br>   - The function calls <code>get_named_object_name(name, name_sz, name_full, &amp;name_full_sz)</code>. The <code>name</code> parameter is not tainted, but the result of this function is critical for determining the object to read. If this function fails, it returns an error code, and no further processing occurs.<br><br>3. **Open Persistent Object**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_OpenPersistentObject(storageid, name_full, name_full_sz, flags, &amp;h)</code>. This function attempts to open a persistent object based on the name derived from the previous step. If it fails, it logs an error and returns an error code. The <code>name_full</code> variable is not tainted since it is derived from a constant name.<br><br>4. **Read Object Data**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_ReadObjectData(h, value, value_sz, count)</code>. Here, the <code>value</code> buffer is where the data is written. If the read operation is successful, the data written to <code>value</code> could be tainted if it is influenced by user-controlled data in the persistent storage.<br>   - If this operation fails, it logs an error message and returns an error code.<br><br>5. **Close Object**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_CloseObject(h)</code> to close the persistent object handle. This does not affect taint but is a necessary cleanup step.<br><br>6. **Return Value**:<br>   - The function returns the result of the read operation. If the read operation is successful, the <code>value</code> buffer will contain data that may or may not be tainted, depending on the contents of the persistent storage.<br><br>### Taint Propagation Summary<br>- The <code>name</code> parameter is not tainted, as it is a constant string. However, it is used to access potentially sensitive data.<br>- The <code>value</code> parameter is where data is written, and if the read operation is successful, it will contain data from persistent storage. The taint of this data depends on the contents of the storage, which may or may not be influenced by previous user-controlled inputs.<br>- The function does not introduce new taint but operates on potentially sensitive data, which could be tainted if the persistent storage contains user-controlled data.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the <code>read_value</code> function does not propagate taint from user-controlled inputs, as the <code>name</code> parameter is a constant. However, it reads data into the <code>value</code> buffer, which could be tainted depending on the contents of the persistent storage. The function&#x27;s behavior is critical in determining whether tainted data reaches sinks in the application. Care should be taken to ensure that the data stored in persistent storage is validated and sanitized to prevent vulnerabilities.

To analyze the <code>TEE_ReadObjectData</code> function in the context of taint data flow, we will focus on how tainted data could affect the parameters <code>arg0</code> and <code>arg2</code>, which correspond to the <code>value</code> and <code>value_sz</code> parameters in the <code>read_value</code> function. Since the implementation of <code>TEE_ReadObjectData</code> is unavailable, we will analyze the potential taint propagation based on the expected behavior of this function and the context provided.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The <code>TEE_ReadObjectData</code> function is expected to read data from a persistent object into a buffer. The parameters are typically as follows:<br>- <code>arg0</code>: A pointer to the buffer where the data will be read (corresponds to <code>value</code> in <code>read_value</code>).<br>- <code>arg1</code>: The size of the buffer (corresponds to <code>value_sz</code> in <code>read_value</code>).<br>- <code>arg2</code>: A pointer to a variable that will hold the number of bytes read (corresponds to <code>count</code> in <code>read_value</code>).<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- **Tainted Input**: The <code>value</code> buffer (arg0) is where the data will be written, and it is tainted in the context of the previous function calls. The <code>value_sz</code> parameter (arg1) is the size of the buffer, which is not tainted but is derived from the context of the function. The <code>count</code> parameter (arg2) is a pointer that will hold the number of bytes read, and it is also not tainted.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - The <code>value</code> buffer (arg0) is tainted because it is intended to receive data from persistent storage. If the data read from the storage is influenced by user-controlled inputs, the taint will propagate to this buffer.<br>   - The <code>value_sz</code> parameter (arg1) is not tainted, as it is a size value that is determined by the context of the function. However, it is crucial for ensuring that the read operation does not exceed the buffer size.<br>   - The <code>count</code> parameter (arg2) is a pointer to a variable that will hold the number of bytes read. This variable itself is not tainted, but it will be updated based on the read operation.<br><br>2. **Data Read Operation**:<br>   - The <code>TEE_ReadObjectData</code> function is expected to read data from the persistent object into the <code>value</code> buffer. The behavior of this function is critical in determining whether tainted data is written to <code>value</code>.<br>   - If the persistent storage contains user-controlled data, the data read into <code>value</code> will be tainted. This is a significant point of concern, as it could lead to vulnerabilities if the data is not properly validated or sanitized.<br><br>3. **Count Update**:<br>   - The <code>count</code> variable (arg2) will be updated to reflect the number of bytes read from the persistent object. If the read operation is successful, this count will indicate how much data was written to the <code>value</code> buffer.<br>   - While <code>count</code> itself is not tainted, it is important to note that it reflects the outcome of the read operation, which could involve tainted data.<br><br>### Data Aliases and Tainted Data Operations<br>- The <code>value</code> buffer (arg0) is a direct alias for the data that will be affected by the read operation. If the data read from the persistent storage is tainted, then <code>value</code> will also be tainted.<br>- The <code>count</code> variable (arg2) is indirectly affected by the tainted data operation, as it will indicate how many bytes of potentially tainted data were read into <code>value</code>.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the <code>TEE_ReadObjectData</code> function is a critical point in the taint analysis, as it is responsible for reading data into the <code>value</code> buffer. If the persistent storage contains user-controlled data, the taint will propagate to <code>value</code>, making it potentially vulnerable. The <code>value_sz</code> parameter ensures that the read operation does not exceed the buffer size, while the <code>count</code> variable reflects the outcome of the read operation. It is essential to ensure that the data stored in persistent storage is validated and sanitized to prevent vulnerabilities associated with tainted data.

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flow.

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes the following parameters:
- `void *sess`: Unused session parameter.
- `uint32_t cmd`: Command identifier.
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters that can be tainted.

### Tainted Parameters
- The parameters `pt` and `params` are considered tainted. The `params` array is particularly important as it can contain sensitive data.

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - `params` is an array of `TEE_Param`, which can contain multiple fields that may be tainted.
   - `pt` is a `uint32_t` that may also be influenced by tainted data.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of `cmd`.
   - The value of `cmd` is not tainted directly, but it determines which function is called next, thus controlling the flow of tainted data.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `read_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Tainted data from `params` is passed to this function, propagating the taint.
     - The `pt` parameter is also passed, which may influence the behavior of `read_persist_value`.

   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `write_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Similar to the previous case, tainted data from `params` is passed, propagating the taint.
     - The `pt` parameter is also passed, which may influence the behavior of `write_persist_value`.

   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `delete_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Again, tainted data from `params` is passed, propagating the taint.
     - The `pt` parameter is also passed, which may influence the behavior of `delete_persist_value`.

   - **Default Case**:
     - Logs an error message if the command is not supported.
     - No taint propagation occurs here since no tainted parameters are used.

4. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `params` array is a pointer to `TEE_Param`, which means that any modifications to the elements of `params` within the called functions (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`) can affect the original data.
   - If any of these functions modify the contents of `params`, the taint will persist in the modified data.

5. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The taint from `params` is propagated to the return values of the functions called within each case.
   - If any of the functions (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`) return a result that depends on the tainted data, the taint will continue to propagate.

### Summary of Taint Data Flow
- Tainted parameters: `params` and `pt`.
- Taint is propagated through the function calls based on the command specified by `cmd`.
- The `params` array is a pointer, allowing for potential modifications that can affect the original data.
- The taint is carried through to the return values of the invoked functions, which may further propagate the taint depending on their implementations.

### Conclusion
The `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function effectively propagates tainted data through its control flow and function calls. Care should be taken in the implementation of the called functions to ensure that they handle tainted data appropriately and do not inadvertently leak sensitive information.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: delete_persist_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `delete_persist_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` flows through the function, identify any new taint propagation, and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `delete_persist_value` takes the following parameters:
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters, which is tainted from the previous function.

### Tainted Input
- The `params` array is tainted, specifically `params[0].memref.buffer` and `params[0].memref.size`, which are used to access the data that may be sensitive.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The `params` array is tainted, and we focus on `params[0]`, which contains a `memref` structure with:
     - `buffer`: A pointer to the data (potentially tainted).
     - `size`: The size of the data (also potentially tainted).

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function first checks if `pt` matches the expected parameter type (`exp_pt`).
   - If `pt` does not match, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`, and no taint propagation occurs.

3. **Tainted Data Extraction**:
   - If the parameter type is valid, the function extracts:
     - `name_buf` is assigned `params[0].memref.buffer`, which is tainted.
     - `name_buf_sz` is assigned `params[0].memref.size`, which is also tainted.

4. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The taint from `name_buf` and `name_buf_sz` is now in use within the function. Any operations performed on these variables will carry the taint.
   - The function checks if `name_buf` starts with the string `ROLLBACK_PROT` using `strncmp`. This operation does not modify the data but checks for a specific condition. If the condition is met, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`, preventing further processing of the tainted data.

5. **Function Call**:
   - The function calls `delete_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz)`, passing the tainted `name_buf` and `name_buf_sz` as arguments.
   - This is a critical point where tainted data reaches a potential sink. The `delete_value` function is expected to handle the deletion of the value identified by `name_buf`. If `delete_value` performs operations that could expose or mishandle the tainted data, it could lead to security issues.

6. **Return Value**:
   - The result of `delete_value` is stored in `res`, which is returned at the end of the function. If `delete_value` returns a result based on the tainted data, the taint will propagate through to the caller of `delete_persist_value`.

### Summary of Taint Data Flow
- Tainted input: `params[0].memref.buffer` and `params[0].memref.size`.
- Taint is propagated to `name_buf` and `name_buf_sz`.
- The check against `ROLLBACK_PROT` does not modify the taint but prevents further processing if the condition is met.
- The tainted data reaches the `delete_value` function, which is a potential sink for the tainted data.

### Conclusion
The `delete_persist_value` function effectively propagates tainted data from the `params` array to local variables and subsequently to a function call that may act as a sink. Care should be taken in the implementation of `delete_value` to ensure that it handles the tainted data securely and does not expose sensitive information.</pre>

<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: delete_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `delete_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input from the previous function (`name` and `name_sz`) flows through this function, identify any new taint propagation, and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `delete_value` takes the following parameters:
- `char *name`: A pointer to the name of the object to be deleted (tainted input).
- `size_t name_sz`: The size of the name (tainted input).

### Tainted Input
- The `name` parameter is tainted, as it comes from the `params` array in the previous function (`delete_persist_value`).
- The `name_sz` parameter is also tainted, as it represents the size of the tainted `name`.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The function receives `name` and `name_sz`, both of which are tainted.

2. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The taint from `name` and `name_sz` is carried into the function and will propagate through various operations.

3. **Function Call**:
   - The first operation is a call to `get_named_object_name(name, name_sz, name_full, &amp;name_full_sz)`.
     - This function is expected to process the tainted `name` and `name_sz` to generate a full object name, which is stored in `name_full`.
     - If `get_named_object_name` uses the tainted data in a way that could expose it or modify it, the taint will propagate to `name_full` and `name_full_sz`.
     - The result of this function call is stored in `res`. If `res` is non-zero, the function returns early, and no further taint propagation occurs.

4. **Opening Persistent Object**:
   - The next operation is `TEE_OpenPersistentObject(storageid, name_full, name_full_sz, flags, &amp;h)`.
     - Here, `name_full` (which may be tainted if it was derived from the tainted `name`) is used to open a persistent object.
     - If `name_full` contains sensitive information, this operation could expose it, making it a potential sink for tainted data.
     - The result of this operation is also stored in `res`. If it fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns.

5. **Closing and Deleting Persistent Object**:
   - The function then calls `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1(h)`.
     - This function is responsible for closing and deleting the persistent object identified by the handle `h`.
     - If `h` was derived from a tainted `name`, this operation could also be considered a sink for tainted data.
     - The result of this operation is again stored in `res`, and if it fails, an error message is logged.

6. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the result stored in `res`, which may reflect the outcome of operations that involved tainted data.

### Summary of Taint Data Flow
- Tainted input: `name` and `name_sz`.
- Taint is propagated through the function, particularly to `name_full` and `name_full_sz`.
- The function calls `get_named_object_name`, which may modify or expose tainted data.
- The call to `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` uses `name_full`, which could be tainted, making it a potential sink.
- The call to `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1` also represents a potential sink for tainted data.

### Conclusion
The `delete_value` function effectively propagates tainted data from its parameters through various operations. Care should be taken in the implementation of `get_named_object_name`, `TEE_OpenPersistentObject`, and `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1` to ensure that they handle tainted data securely and do not expose sensitive information. The function has multiple points where tainted data could reach sinks, necessitating careful validation and handling of the inputs.</pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Since the implementation of `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1` is not provided, we will perform a taint analysis based on the function signature and its expected behavior. We will track how the tainted input from the previous function (`arg0`, which corresponds to the handle `h` obtained from `TEE_OpenPersistentObject`) flows through this function, note any new taint propagation, and identify if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1` is expected to perform two main operations:
1. Close a persistent object identified by the handle passed as an argument.
2. Delete the persistent object from storage.

### Tainted Input
- The tainted input is `arg0`, which corresponds to the handle `h` obtained from the previous function (`delete_value`). This handle is derived from a potentially tainted name, which means it may represent a sensitive object in persistent storage.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The function receives `arg0` (the handle `h`), which is tainted because it was derived from the tainted `name` in the previous function.

2. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The taint from `arg0` is carried into the function. Since `arg0` is a handle to a persistent object, it is crucial to understand how this handle is used within the function.
   - The function is expected to perform operations that involve accessing or modifying the persistent object associated with the handle.

3. **Operations on Tainted Data**:
   - While we do not have the implementation details, we can infer that the function will likely perform operations such as:
     - Validating the handle to ensure it is valid and corresponds to an existing persistent object.
     - Accessing the data associated with the handle, which could involve reading or modifying sensitive information.
     - Deleting the object from persistent storage, which may involve removing sensitive data permanently.

4. **Potential Sinks**:
   - If the function performs any logging, error handling, or data exposure based on the handle, this could represent a sink for tainted data.
   - For example, if the function logs the handle or any associated data without proper sanitization, it could lead to information leakage.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The function is expected to return a result indicating success or failure. If the result is based on operations involving the tainted handle, the taint may propagate to the caller.

### Summary of Taint Data Flow
- Tainted input: `arg0` (the handle `h`).
- Taint is propagated through the function as the handle is used to perform operations on the associated persistent object.
- The function likely interacts with sensitive data, making it a potential sink for tainted data.
- Without the implementation details, we cannot specify the exact operations, but the nature of the function suggests that it handles sensitive information.

### Conclusion
The `TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1` function is critical in the taint analysis chain as it operates on a tainted handle derived from potentially sensitive data. Care should be taken in its implementation to ensure that it securely handles the tainted input and does not expose sensitive information through logging or error messages. The function represents a potential sink for tainted data, and its behavior should be carefully validated to prevent information leakage or unauthorized access.</pre>

The <code>params</code> array is particularly important as it can contain sensitive data.<br><br>### Data Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - <code>params</code> is an array of <code>TEE_Param</code>, which can contain multiple fields that may be tainted.<br>   - <code>pt</code> is a <code>uint32_t</code> that may also be influenced by tainted data.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function uses a <code>switch</code> statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of <code>cmd</code>.<br>   - The value of <code>cmd</code> is not tainted directly, but it determines which function is called next, thus controlling the flow of tainted data.<br><br>3. **Case Analysis**:<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>read_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Tainted data from <code>params</code> is passed to this function, propagating the taint.<br>     - The <code>pt</code> parameter is also passed, which may influence the behavior of <code>read_persist_value</code>.<br><br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>write_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Similar to the previous case, tainted data from <code>params</code> is passed, propagating the taint.<br>     - The <code>pt</code> parameter is also passed, which may influence the behavior of <code>write_persist_value</code>.<br><br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>delete_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Again, tainted data from <code>params</code> is passed, propagating the taint.<br>     - The <code>pt</code> parameter is also passed, which may influence the behavior of <code>delete_persist_value</code>.<br><br>   - **Default Case**:<br>     - Logs an error message if the command is not supported.<br>     - No taint propagation occurs here since no tainted parameters are used.<br><br>4. **Data Aliases**:<br>   - The <code>params</code> array is a pointer to <code>TEE_Param</code>, which means that any modifications to the elements of <code>params</code> within the called functions (<code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, <code>delete_persist_value</code>) can affect the original data.<br>   - If any of these functions modify the contents of <code>params</code>, the taint will persist in the modified data.<br><br>5. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - The taint from <code>params</code> is propagated to the return values of the functions called within each case.<br>   - If any of the functions (<code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, <code>delete_persist_value</code>) return a result that depends on the tainted data, the taint will continue to propagate.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Data Flow<br>- Tainted parameters: <code>params</code> and <code>pt</code>.<br>- Taint is propagated through the function calls based on the command specified by <code>cmd</code>.<br>- The <code>params</code> array is a pointer, allowing for potential modifications that can affect the original data.<br>- The taint is carried through to the return values of the invoked functions, which may further propagate the taint depending on their implementations.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>The <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function effectively propagates tainted data through its control flow and function calls. Care should be taken in the implementation of the called functions to ensure that they handle tainted data appropriately and do not inadvertently leak sensitive information.

Since the implementation of <code>TEE_CloseAndDeletePersistentObject1</code> is not provided, we will perform a taint analysis based on the function signature and its expected behavior.

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flow.

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes the following parameters:
- `void *sess`: Unused session parameter.
- `uint32_t cmd`: Command identifier.
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters that can be tainted.

### Tainted Parameters
- The parameters `cmd` and `params` are the focus of our taint analysis. The `params` array is particularly important as it can contain multiple values that may be tainted.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `params` array is tainted when it is passed to the function. The taint originates from the caller of `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of `cmd`. The value of `cmd` is not tainted by itself, but it controls which function is called next, potentially affecting the flow of tainted data.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `read_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - The `params` array is passed directly to this function, propagating the taint.
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `write_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Again, the `params` array is passed directly, propagating the taint.
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `delete_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - The `params` array is passed directly, propagating the taint.
   - **Default Case**:
     - If `cmd` does not match any of the cases, an error message is logged, and `TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` is returned. No taint propagation occurs here since no tainted data is used.

4. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `params` array is an array of `TEE_Param` structures. If any of the elements in this array are pointers or contain pointers, they may create additional data aliases. For example, if `TEE_Param` contains a pointer to a buffer, that buffer may also be tainted if it is modified or accessed.

5. **Operations Propagating Taint**:
   - The function calls (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`) are critical points where taint may propagate further. If these functions operate on the `params` array or any of its members, they may continue to propagate the taint.

6. **Implicit Flow**:
   - The control flow of the `switch` statement creates an implicit flow based on the value of `cmd`. If `cmd` is tainted (e.g., if it is derived from user input), it could affect which command is executed, thus indirectly affecting the flow of tainted data.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The `params` array is tainted upon entry to the function.
- The taint propagates through the function as it is passed to the respective command functions.
- The `cmd` parameter does not directly carry taint but controls the flow of execution, which can lead to tainted data being processed.
- Any modifications to the `params` array or its elements in the called functions will continue to propagate the taint.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function effectively propagates tainted data through its parameters, particularly the `params` array. The control flow based on the `cmd` parameter determines which functions are called, and thus which tainted data may be processed. Care should be taken in the implementation of the called functions to ensure that they handle tainted data appropriately.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: write_persist_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `write_persist_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (specifically `params[0]` and `params[1]`) flows through the function. We will identify any new taint propagation, check if tainted data reaches any sinks, and note any operations that may affect the taint status.

### Tainted Input
- The `params` array is tainted as it is passed from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`. Specifically, `params[0]` and `params[1]` are of interest, as they are expected to contain memory references.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `params` array is tainted upon entry to the function. The taint originates from the caller of `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`.

2. **Parameter Type Check**:
   - The function checks if `pt` matches the expected parameter types (`exp_pt`). If it does not match, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`, and no taint propagation occurs.

3. **Buffer Assignments**:
   - `name_buf` is assigned from `params[0].memref.buffer`, which is tainted. This means `name_buf` is now tainted.
   - `name_buf_sz` is assigned from `params[0].memref.size`, which is also tainted indirectly since it is derived from a tainted parameter.

4. **Validation Check**:
   - The function calls `check_valid_value(name_buf)`. If this function uses `name_buf`, it will operate on tainted data. If it returns `TEE_SUCCESS`, the taint remains; if it returns an error, the function logs an error message and returns without further processing.

5. **Overwrite Logic**:
   - The function checks if `name_buf` starts with a specific vendor prefix or the `ROLLBACK_PROT` string. If it does, the `overwrite` flag is set to `false`. This logic does not affect taint propagation but controls subsequent operations.

6. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `value_sz` is assigned from `params[1].memref.size`, which is tainted. 
   - The function allocates memory for `value` using `TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)`. If `value_sz` is derived from tainted data, the allocated memory is indirectly tainted.

7. **Data Movement**:
   - The function uses `TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)`. This operation copies data from a tainted source (`params[1].memref.buffer`) to a tainted destination (`value`). Thus, `value` is now tainted.

8. **Conditional Logic**:
   - The function checks if `name_buf` starts with the vendor prefix and whether `CFG_FIOVB_VENDOR_CREATE` is enabled. If not, it sets `res` to `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS` and logs an error. This does not affect taint propagation.
   - If `name_buf` does not match `BOOTFIRM_VER`, it calls `write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite)`. Here, `name_buf`, `name_buf_sz`, `value`, and `value_sz` are all tainted, so the call to `write_value` operates on tainted data.
   - If `name_buf` matches `BOOTFIRM_VER`, it calls `increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz)`, which also operates on tainted data.

9. **Memory Deallocation**:
   - The function calls `TEE_Free(value)`, which frees the memory allocated for `value`. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.

10. **Return Value**:
    - The function returns `res`, which may be influenced by the operations performed on tainted data. If any of the operations succeed, the taint may reach the return value, depending on how the called functions handle the tainted data.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The `params` array is tainted upon entry to the function.
- The taint propagates to `name_buf`, `name_buf_sz`, `value`, and `value_sz` through assignments and memory operations.
- The function performs operations on tainted data, specifically in the calls to `write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware`, which are potential sinks for tainted data.
- The function does not sanitize or validate the contents of `params[0]` and `params[1]` beyond the initial checks, meaning that tainted data can reach critical operations.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `write_persist_value` function effectively propagates tainted data from the `params` array through various assignments and operations. The function calls that operate on tainted data represent potential sinks, and care should be taken to ensure that these functions handle tainted data appropriately to avoid security vulnerabilities.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: increase_boot_firmware</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `increase_boot_firmware` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `new_ver_str` and `new_ver_sz` (which are derived from the previous function `write_persist_value`) flow through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- The inputs to `increase_boot_firmware` are:
  - `new_ver_str`: A pointer to a character string that is tainted (it was assigned from `params[1].memref.buffer` in `write_persist_value`).
  - `new_ver_sz`: A size value that is also tainted (it was assigned from `params[1].memref.size` in `write_persist_value`).

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The parameters `new_ver_str` and `new_ver_sz` are tainted upon entry to the function, as they originate from the tainted `params` array in the previous function.

2. **Rollback Protection Check**:
   - The function first checks if the system is rollback protected by calling `is_rollback_protected()`. This function does not operate on tainted data, so it does not affect taint propagation.
   - The function then checks if the new version string is incremental by calling `is_version_incremental(new_ver_str, new_ver_sz)`. This function operates on the tainted `new_ver_str` and `new_ver_sz`. If this function returns `false`, it indicates that the version update is not permitted, and the function logs an error message and returns `TEE_ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`. The taint remains in this case, as the function is still processing tainted data.

3. **Calling `write_value`**:
   - If the rollback protection check passes and the version is incremental, the function calls `write_value(BOOTFIRM_VER, strlen(BOOTFIRM_VER) + 1, new_ver_str, new_ver_sz, true)`.
   - Here, `BOOTFIRM_VER` is a constant string (not tainted), but `new_ver_str` and `new_ver_sz` are tainted. This means that the call to `write_value` operates on tainted data, propagating the taint further.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the result of the `write_value` call. If `write_value` processes the tainted data, the return value may also be influenced by the tainted inputs.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The `new_ver_str` and `new_ver_sz` parameters are tainted upon entry to the function.
- The taint propagates through the function, particularly in the call to `is_version_incremental`, which operates on tainted data.
- The function calls `write_value`, which also operates on tainted data, representing a potential sink for tainted data.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `increase_boot_firmware` function effectively propagates tainted data from the `write_persist_value` function through its parameters. The checks for rollback protection and version incrementality do not sanitize the tainted data, and the call to `write_value` represents a critical point where tainted data could lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly. Care should be taken to ensure that the `write_value` function appropriately manages the tainted data it receives.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: is_rollback_protected</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `is_rollback_protected` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- The `is_rollback_protected` function does not take any parameters, but it is called from the `increase_boot_firmware` function, which processes tainted data. However, the `is_rollback_protected` function itself does not directly receive any tainted input.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Function Overview**:
   - The `is_rollback_protected` function checks if rollback protection is enabled by attempting to read a value associated with the `ROLLBACK_PROT` key.

2. **Local Variables**:
   - The function declares local variables:
     - `TEE_Result res`: Initialized to `TEE_SUCCESS`.
     - `uint32_t value_sz`: Set to `MAX_SIMPLE_VALUE_SIZE`.
     - `char value[MAX_SIMPLE_VALUE_SIZE]`: A buffer to hold the value read from storage.
     - `uint32_t count`: Used to store the count of values read.

3. **Reading the Value**:
   - The function calls `read_value(ROLLBACK_PROT, strlen(ROLLBACK_PROT) + 1, value, value_sz, &amp;count)`.
     - The `ROLLBACK_PROT` string is a constant and not tainted.
     - The `value` buffer is a local variable and does not carry taint from the previous functions.
     - The `value_sz` is also a constant size and does not carry taint.
     - The `count` variable is passed by reference to store the number of values read.

4. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The `read_value` function is critical here. If `read_value` reads data from a source that could be influenced by tainted data (e.g., a storage mechanism that could be modified by user input), then the data read into `value` could potentially be tainted. However, this depends on the implementation of `read_value`, which is not provided in the current context.
   - If `read_value` returns `TEE_SUCCESS`, the function logs a message indicating that rollback protection is enabled, but this does not affect taint propagation.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `true` if rollback protection is enabled (i.e., if `read_value` succeeds) and `false` otherwise. The return value itself does not carry taint since it is derived from the result of a function that does not process tainted data directly.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The `is_rollback_protected` function does not directly process any tainted input.
- The only potential for taint propagation comes from the `read_value` function. If `read_value` reads data that is influenced by tainted data, then the contents of `value` could be tainted, but this is contingent on the implementation of `read_value`.
- The function does not have any sinks for tainted data, as it does not perform any operations that would expose or utilize tainted data directly.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `is_rollback_protected` function itself does not propagate tainted data, as it does not take any parameters and operates on local variables. The only potential for taint propagation lies in the `read_value` function, which could read tainted data depending on its implementation. If `read_value` is designed to read from a source that could be influenced by user input or other tainted data, then there is a risk of taint propagation. However, without the implementation details of `read_value`, we cannot definitively conclude whether taint reaches any sinks in this function.</pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: read_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `read_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- The inputs to `read_value` are:
  - `name`: A character string that is expected to be a name for the object to read.
  - `name_sz`: The size of the `name` string.
  - `value`: A buffer where the read data will be stored (this is tainted if it is influenced by previous tainted data).
  - `value_sz`: The size of the `value` buffer.
  - `count`: A pointer to a variable that will store the number of bytes read.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `name` parameter is derived from the `ROLLBACK_PROT` constant in the context of the previous function, and it is not tainted.
   - The `value` buffer is where the function will write data, and it is tainted if it was influenced by previous tainted data (specifically from the `increase_boot_firmware` function).
   - The `name_sz` and `value_sz` parameters are not tainted as they are derived from constants or sizes.

2. **Get Named Object Name**:
   - The function calls `get_named_object_name(name, name_sz, name_full, &amp;name_full_sz)`.
   - The `name` parameter is not tainted, so the result of this function does not propagate any taint. If this function modifies `name_full`, it does not affect taint propagation since `name_full` is a local variable.

3. **Open Persistent Object**:
   - The function calls `TEE_OpenPersistentObject(storageid, name_full, name_full_sz, flags, &amp;h)`.
   - This function attempts to open a persistent object based on the `name_full`. The result of this operation is stored in `res`. If it fails, the function logs an error and returns early. This operation does not propagate taint since it does not involve any tainted data.

4. **Read Object Data**:
   - The function calls `TEE_ReadObjectData(h, value, value_sz, count)`.
   - Here, `value` is the buffer where data will be written. If `value` was tainted before this call (as it is derived from the previous function), the taint remains. The `value_sz` parameter indicates how much data to read, and if it is derived from tainted data, it could also affect the operation.
   - If `TEE_ReadObjectData` reads data from a source that could be influenced by tainted data, then the data written to `value` could be tainted. The `count` variable will store the number of bytes read, which may also be influenced by the tainted `value_sz`.

5. **Close Object**:
   - The function calls `TEE_CloseObject(h)` to close the persistent object handle. This operation does not affect taint propagation.

6. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `res`, which indicates the success or failure of the read operation. If the read operation succeeds and writes tainted data to `value`, the taint may propagate to the return value indirectly, depending on how the calling function uses the result.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The `name` parameter is not tainted, while the `value` buffer is tainted if it was influenced by previous tainted data.
- The function does not propagate taint through the `get_named_object_name` and `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` calls, as they do not involve tainted data.
- The critical point for taint propagation is the call to `TEE_ReadObjectData`, which can write tainted data to the `value` buffer if the source of the data is influenced by tainted data.
- The return value of the function may indicate success or failure but does not carry taint itself.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `read_value` function has the potential to propagate tainted data through the `value` buffer if the data read from the persistent object is influenced by previous tainted data. The function does not directly process tainted input, but it interacts with potentially tainted data through the `value` parameter. Care should be taken to ensure that the data read from persistent storage is properly validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: get_named_object_name</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `get_named_object_name` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- The inputs to `get_named_object_name` are:
  - `name_orig`: A character string that is expected to be the original name of the object (tainted if influenced by previous tainted data).
  - `name_orig_size`: The size of the `name_orig` string.
  - `name`: A buffer where the concatenated name will be stored.
  - `name_size`: A pointer to a variable that will store the size of the concatenated name.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `name_orig` parameter is tainted if it was influenced by previous tainted data (specifically from the `read_value` function).
   - The `name_orig_size` parameter is not tainted as it is derived from the size of `name_orig`.
   - The `name` buffer is a local variable that will be populated with data, and it starts as untainted.

2. **Prefix Length Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the length of the `named_value_prefix` using `strlen(named_value_prefix)`. This operation does not involve any tainted data and does not affect taint propagation.

3. **Parameter Size Check**:
   - The function checks if the combined size of `name_orig_size` and `pref_len` exceeds `TEE_OBJECT_ID_MAX_LEN`. If it does, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`. This check does not propagate taint, as it only involves size calculations.

4. **Memory Operations**:
   - The function uses `TEE_MemMove(name, named_value_prefix, pref_len)` to copy the prefix into the `name` buffer. This operation does not involve tainted data, so `name` remains untainted at this point.
   - The function then uses `TEE_MemMove(name + pref_len, name_orig, name_orig_size)` to concatenate the `name_orig` string to the `name` buffer. Since `name_orig` is tainted, this operation propagates the taint to the `name` buffer. After this operation, the `name` buffer contains tainted data.

5. **Size Assignment**:
   - The function assigns the total size of the concatenated name to `*name_size` using `*name_size = name_orig_size + pref_len`. This operation does not affect taint propagation, as it only involves size calculations.

6. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `TEE_SUCCESS`, indicating that the operation was successful. The return value itself does not carry taint, but it indicates that the `name` buffer now contains tainted data.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The `name_orig` parameter is tainted if it was influenced by previous tainted data.
- The `name` buffer starts as untainted but becomes tainted after the `TEE_MemMove` operation that concatenates `name_orig` to it.
- The function does not have any sinks for tainted data, but the tainted `name` buffer is now ready for use in subsequent operations.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `get_named_object_name` function propagates tainted data from the `name_orig` parameter to the `name` buffer through memory operations. The function does not directly process tainted input but modifies the `name` buffer to include potentially tainted data. Care should be taken in subsequent functions that use the `name` buffer to ensure that they handle the tainted data appropriately to avoid security vulnerabilities.</pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: strlen</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `strlen` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input flows through this function. Since `strlen` is a standard library function, we will consider its behavior and how it interacts with tainted data.

### Tainted Input
- The input to `strlen` is:
  - `arg0`: A pointer to a character string whose length is to be calculated. This string is tainted if it was influenced by previous tainted data (specifically from the `get_named_object_name` function).

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameter**:
   - The `arg0` parameter is tainted if it points to a string that was derived from tainted data. In this case, it is the `name` buffer that was populated in the `get_named_object_name` function, which contains potentially tainted data.

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - The `strlen` function calculates the length of the string pointed to by `arg0` by iterating through the characters until it encounters a null terminator (`&#x27;\0&#x27;`). The function does not modify the string or its contents; it only reads the data to determine the length.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - Since `strlen` does not modify the input string, it does not propagate taint in the traditional sense (i.e., it does not create new tainted data). However, the output of `strlen` (the length of the string) is influenced by the contents of the tainted string.
   - The return value of `strlen` is the length of the tainted string, which means that any subsequent operations that depend on this length may also be affected by the taint.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The return value of `strlen` is an integer representing the length of the string. While this value itself is not tainted, it is derived from tainted data. If this length is used in subsequent operations (e.g., memory allocation, buffer copying), those operations may be affected by the taint.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The `arg0` parameter is tainted if it points to a string that was influenced by previous tainted data.
- The `strlen` function does not modify the input string and does not create new tainted data, but it returns a length that is derived from potentially tainted data.
- The return value of `strlen` is not tainted, but it is influenced by the tainted input, which could lead to taint propagation in subsequent operations that use this length.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `strlen` function itself does not propagate taint in the traditional sense, as it does not modify the input data. However, it operates on potentially tainted data, and the length it returns is derived from that tainted input. Care should be taken in subsequent functions that use the length returned by `strlen`, as they may inadvertently operate on tainted data if they rely on this length for further processing.</pre>

To analyze the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> as they flow through the function.

If it does not match, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>, and no further processing occurs. This check does not affect the taint status.<br><br>3. **Tainted Data Usage**:<br>   - <code>name_buf</code> is assigned the value of <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code>, which is tainted.<br>   - <code>name_buf_sz</code> is assigned the size of <code>params[0].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted but is derived from the tainted input.<br><br>4. **Validation Check**:<br>   - The function calls <code>check_valid_value(name_buf)</code>, which uses the tainted <code>name_buf</code>. If this function returns an error, an error message is logged, and the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>. This indicates that the tainted data is being used in a validation context.<br><br>5. **Overwrite Logic**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with a vendor prefix or a rollback protection string. If it does, the <code>overwrite</code> flag is set to <code>false</code>. This logic does not affect the taint but shows that the tainted data influences control flow.<br><br>6. **Memory Allocation**:<br>   - <code>value_sz</code> is assigned the size of <code>params[1].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted but derived from tainted input.<br>   - <code>value</code> is allocated memory using <code>TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)</code>. If the allocation fails, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY</code>. The allocation itself does not propagate taint.<br><br>7. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - The function uses <code>TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)</code>, which copies the tainted data from <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> to the newly allocated <code>value</code>. This operation propagates the taint from <code>params[1]</code> to <code>value</code>.<br><br>8. **Conditional Logic**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with a vendor prefix and whether the configuration allows creating vendor variables. If not allowed, it logs an error message and sets <code>res</code> to <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>.<br>   - If <code>name_buf</code> does not match the boot firmware version, it calls <code>write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite)</code>, where both <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code> are tainted.<br>   - If it matches the boot firmware version, it calls <code>increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz)</code>, where <code>value</code> is tainted.<br><br>9. **Freeing Memory**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_Free(value)</code> to free the allocated memory. This does not affect taint but is important for resource management.<br><br>10. **Return Value**:<br>    - The function returns <code>res</code>, which may indicate success or failure based on the operations performed. If <code>write_value</code> or <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> processes tainted data, the taint remains.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Data Flow<br>- The <code>params</code> array is tainted upon entry into <code>write_persist_value</code>.<br>- The taint propagates to <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code> through assignments and memory operations.<br>- The function uses tainted data in validation checks and further processing, which could lead to potential security issues if not handled properly.<br>- Tainted data reaches potential sinks in the calls to <code>write_value</code> and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>, which may perform operations based on the tainted data.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>The <code>write_persist_value</code> function effectively propagates taint from the <code>params</code> array to local variables and through function calls. Care should be taken in the implementation of <code>check_valid_value</code>, <code>write_value</code>, and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> to ensure they handle tainted data appropriately and do not introduce vulnerabilities.

To analyze the <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>new_ver_str</code> (which is derived from the previous function <code>write_persist_value</code>) flows through this function.

This function does not use tainted data and does not affect the taint status.<br><br>3. **Validation Check**:<br>   - The function then calls <code>is_version_incremental(new_ver_str, new_ver_sz)</code>, which uses the tainted <code>new_ver_str</code>.

To analyze the <code>is_rollback_protected</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>is_rollback_protected</code> does not take any parameters. Instead, it checks if rollback protection is enabled by reading a value associated with <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code>.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The function does not directly receive any tainted input parameters. However, it is called from the <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> function, which uses tainted data (<code>new_ver_str</code>) to determine if the firmware version can be updated.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial State**:<br>   - The function does not have any tainted input parameters. However, it is part of a control flow that is influenced by tainted data from the previous function (<code>increase_boot_firmware</code>).<br><br>2. **Reading Rollback Protection Value**:<br>   - The function calls <code>read_value(ROLLBACK_PROT, strlen(ROLLBACK_PROT) + 1, value, value_sz, &amp;count)</code>. This function attempts to read a value associated with the <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code> key into the local <code>value</code> array.<br>   - The <code>value</code> array is not tainted upon entry into this function, but it will be populated by the <code>read_value</code> function.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - The taint propagation in this function is indirect. If <code>read_value</code> retrieves data that is influenced by tainted data (for example, if the value being read is dependent on the state of the system that was modified by tainted inputs), then the <code>value</code> could be considered tainted. However, based on the provided code, we cannot definitively say that the data read into <code>value</code> is tainted without knowing the implementation of <code>read_value</code>.<br><br>4. **Control Flow**:<br>   - If <code>read_value</code> returns <code>TEE_SUCCESS</code>, a debug message is logged indicating that rollback protection is enabled, and the function returns <code>true</code>.<br>   - If <code>read_value</code> does not succeed, the function returns <code>false</code>.<br><br>5. **Return Value**:<br>   - The return value of <code>is_rollback_protected</code> is a boolean indicating whether rollback protection is enabled. This return value is used in the <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> function to determine if the firmware version can be updated.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Data Flow<br>- The <code>is_rollback_protected</code> function does not directly handle tainted input but is influenced by the control flow from the <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> function, which uses tainted data.<br>- The function reads a value into a local buffer (<code>value</code>), but without the implementation details of <code>read_value</code>, we cannot determine if this buffer is tainted.<br>- The function does not propagate taint directly, but it may indirectly affect the flow based on the outcome of the <code>read_value</code> call.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>The <code>is_rollback_protected</code> function does not directly propagate taint, as it does not take any tainted parameters. However, it is part of a control flow that is influenced by tainted data from the <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> function. The function&#x27;s behavior depends on the outcome of <code>read_value</code>, which could potentially involve tainted data if the underlying implementation retrieves values based on previous tainted operations. Care should be taken in the implementation of <code>read_value</code> to ensure it does not introduce vulnerabilities related to tainted data.

This function uses the tainted <code>name</code> to derive a full object name. If this function fails, it returns an error code, and no further processing occurs. The taint status of <code>name_full</code> is unknown without the implementation details of <code>get_named_object_name</code>.<br><br>3. **Opening the Persistent Object**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_OpenPersistentObject(storageid, name_full, name_full_sz, flags, &amp;h)</code>. This function attempts to open a persistent object based on the derived <code>name_full</code>. If it fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns the error code. The taint status of <code>h</code> is not directly relevant, as it is a handle and does not carry data.<br><br>4. **Reading Object Data**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_ReadObjectData(h, value, value_sz, count)</code>. This function attempts to read data into the tainted <code>value</code> buffer. If this operation is successful, the taint from the object being read (if it is influenced by previous tainted data) will propagate into the <code>value</code> buffer.<br>   - If <code>TEE_ReadObjectData</code> fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns the error code. The taint status of <code>value</code> remains, as it is still the buffer where data is being read.<br><br>5. **Closing the Object**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_CloseObject(h)</code> to close the persistent object handle. This operation does not affect taint.<br><br>6. **Return Value**:<br>   - The function returns the result of the read operation, which may indicate success or failure. If the read operation is successful, the taint from the object being read is now in the <code>value</code> buffer.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Data Flow<br>- The <code>name</code> and <code>value</code> parameters are tainted upon entry into <code>read_value</code>.<br>- The taint propagates through the function, particularly in the call to <code>TEE_ReadObjectData</code>, which reads data into the tainted <code>value</code> buffer.<br>- If the read operation is successful, the taint from the object being read is now present in the <code>value</code> buffer, which is a potential sink for tainted data.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>The <code>read_value</code> function effectively propagates taint from the <code>name</code> and <code>value</code> parameters.

If it does, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>. This check does not affect the taint status.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - The function uses <code>TEE_MemMove(name, named_value_prefix, pref_len)</code> to copy the prefix into the <code>name</code> buffer.

To analyze the <code>strlen</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input flows through this function. Since <code>strlen</code> is a standard library function, we will consider its behavior and how it interacts with tainted data.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The <code>strlen</code> function calculates the length of a null-terminated string. It takes a single parameter:<br>- <code>const char *str</code>: A pointer to the string whose length is to be determined.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The input to <code>strlen</code> (referred to as <code>arg0</code>) is derived from the previous function (<code>get_named_object_name</code>), specifically the <code>name</code> buffer, which contains tainted data after concatenating the original name with a prefix.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Input**:<br>   - The <code>arg0</code> parameter (the string passed to <code>strlen</code>) is tainted because it originates from the <code>name</code> buffer, which contains data from the tainted <code>name_orig</code>.<br><br>2. **Function Behavior**:<br>   - The <code>strlen</code> function iterates through the characters of the string pointed to by <code>arg0</code> until it encounters a null terminator (<code>&#x27;\0&#x27;</code>). It counts the number of characters in the string and returns this count as a <code>size_t</code> value.<br>   - Importantly, <code>strlen</code> does not modify the input string; it only reads the data to determine the length.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - Since <code>strlen</code> only reads the data and does not produce any new data or modify the input, it does not propagate taint in the traditional sense. However, the output (the length of the string) is derived from tainted data.<br>   - The return value of <code>strlen</code> is a numeric representation of the length of the tainted string, which itself does not carry taint but is influenced by the tainted input.<br><br>4. **Return Value**:<br>   - The function returns the length of the string as a <code>size_t</code> value. This value is not tainted, but it is based on the tainted input.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Data Flow<br>- The <code>arg0</code> parameter passed to <code>strlen</code> is tainted, as it comes from the <code>name</code> buffer, which contains tainted data.<br>- The <code>strlen</code> function does not propagate taint because it does not modify the input or produce new data; it simply returns the length of the string.<br>- The return value of <code>strlen</code> is a numeric representation of the length of the tainted string, but it does not carry taint itself.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>The <code>strlen</code> function reads the tainted input but does not propagate taint in the traditional sense, as it does not create or modify data. The length returned by <code>strlen</code> is based on tainted data, but the return value itself is not tainted. Care should be taken in subsequent operations that use this length to ensure that any further processing does not inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities related to the original tainted data.

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` flow through the function, identify any data aliases, note operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flow.

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes the following parameters:
- `void *sess`: Unused session parameter.
- `uint32_t cmd`: Command identifier.
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters that can be tainted.

### Tainted Parameters
- `&lt;param_types&gt;`: This is not explicitly mentioned in the function signature but is implied to be part of the `params` array.
- `&lt;params&gt;`: The `params` array is directly passed to the function and can contain tainted data.

### Taint Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `params` array is tainted upon entry into the function. This means that any data within `params` is considered tainted.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of `cmd`. The control flow is dependent on the value of `cmd`, which is not tainted but determines which function is called next.

3. **Function Calls**:
   - The function calls `read_persist_value(pt, params)`, `write_persist_value(pt, params)`, or `delete_persist_value(pt, params)` based on the value of `cmd`. The `params` array is passed to each of these functions, meaning that the taint from `params` propagates to these function calls.

4. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `params` array is a pointer to an array of `TEE_Param` structures. If any of these structures or their members are modified within the called functions, the taint will persist. This means that any modifications to the `params` array or its members in the called functions will still be considered tainted.

5. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The taint propagates through the function calls:
     - If `read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, or `delete_persist_value` use or modify the `params` array, the taint remains.
     - If any of these functions return a value that depends on the tainted `params`, that return value may also be tainted.

6. **Implicit Flow**:
   - The control flow itself does not introduce new taint, but the choice of which function to call based on `cmd` can lead to different paths of execution that may handle the tainted data differently.

7. **Return Values**:
   - The return values of the called functions (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`) are not directly tainted unless they depend on the tainted `params`. The function returns `TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` for unsupported commands, which is not tainted.

### Summary of Taint Data Flow
- The `params` array is tainted upon entry.
- The taint propagates to the functions `read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, and `delete_persist_value` through the `params` parameter.
- Any modifications to `params` or its members within those functions will retain the taint.
- The control flow does not introduce new taint but determines how the tainted data is processed.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function effectively propagates tainted data through its parameters to subsequent function calls. Care should be taken in the implementation of the called functions to ensure that they handle tainted data appropriately and do not inadvertently leak sensitive information or create vulnerabilities.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: write_persist_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `write_persist_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`) flows through this function, note any new taint propagation, and identify if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `write_persist_value` takes the following parameters:
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters, which is tainted from the previous function.

### Tainted Input
- The `params` array is tainted, specifically:
  - `params[0].memref.buffer`: This is expected to contain a name (key) for the persistent value.
  - `params[1].memref.buffer`: This is expected to contain the value to be written.

### Taint Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `params` array is tainted upon entry into the function. Specifically, `params[0].memref.buffer` and `params[1].memref.buffer` are tainted.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function first checks if `pt` matches the expected parameter types. If it does not, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`, and no taint propagation occurs beyond this point.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - **Name Buffer**:
     - `name_buf` is assigned from `params[0].memref.buffer`, which is tainted. Therefore, `name_buf` is also tainted.
   - **Value Buffer**:
     - `value_sz` is assigned from `params[1].memref.size`, and `value` is allocated with `TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)`. If `value` is successfully allocated, it is tainted because it will eventually hold data copied from `params[1].memref.buffer`.
     - The line `TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz);` copies the tainted data from `params[1].memref.buffer` to `value`, propagating the taint.

4. **Sinks**:
   - The function checks if the `name_buf` starts with a vendor prefix or a rollback protection string. If it does, the `overwrite` flag is set to `false`, but this does not affect the taint.
   - The function then calls `write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite);` or `increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz);`. Both of these functions are potential sinks for tainted data:
     - If `write_value` or `increase_boot_firmware` uses or stores the tainted `name_buf` or `value`, then the taint reaches a sink.
   - The return value `res` from these functions may also be influenced by the tainted data, depending on their implementation.

5. **Memory Management**:
   - The allocated `value` is freed with `TEE_Free(value);`. This does not affect taint but is important for memory management.

### Summary of Taint Data Flow
- The `params` array is tainted upon entry.
- The taint propagates to `name_buf` and `value` through assignments and memory operations.
- The function checks for valid parameters and handles specific cases based on the contents of `name_buf`, but these checks do not remove taint.
- The tainted data reaches potential sinks through calls to `write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware`, which may process or store the tainted data.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `write_persist_value` function effectively propagates tainted data from the `params` array to local variables and potentially to external functions that may act as sinks. Care should be taken in the implementation of `write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware` to ensure they handle tainted data appropriately and do not introduce vulnerabilities.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_Malloc</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_Malloc` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `arg0` (which represents the size of the memory to be allocated, derived from `params[1].memref.size` in the `write_persist_value` function) flows through this function, note any new taint propagation, and identify if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `TEE_Malloc` is an external function that is used to allocate memory. The specific implementation details are not provided, but we can analyze the taint flow based on its expected behavior.

### Tainted Input
- The tainted input `arg0` corresponds to `value_sz`, which is derived from `params[1].memref.size`. This value indicates the size of the memory to be allocated.

### Taint Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The input to `TEE_Malloc`, `arg0`, is tainted because it is derived from the tainted `params` array. This means that the size of the memory being requested for allocation is influenced by potentially untrusted data.

2. **Memory Allocation**:
   - The `TEE_Malloc` function is expected to allocate a block of memory of size `arg0`. The taint does not propagate through the allocation process itself, as the function is simply allocating memory based on the size provided.
   - If `arg0` is derived from untrusted input, the allocation size could be manipulated, leading to potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or memory exhaustion if the size is excessively large.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The return value of `TEE_Malloc` is a pointer to the allocated memory. If the allocation is successful, this pointer is assigned to `value` in the `write_persist_value` function.
   - The allocated memory is considered tainted because it is intended to hold data that is copied from the tainted `params[1].memref.buffer`. Thus, the taint propagates to the allocated memory.

4. **Sinks**:
   - The allocated memory itself does not reach a sink directly within `TEE_Malloc`. However, once the memory is allocated, it is used in subsequent operations (e.g., `TEE_MemMove` in `write_persist_value`), which can be considered sinks for tainted data.
   - If the allocated memory is later used to store sensitive information or is passed to other functions that handle it in a way that could lead to exposure, then the taint reaches those sinks.

### Summary of Taint Data Flow
- The input `arg0` (size for allocation) is tainted upon entry into `TEE_Malloc`.
- The function allocates memory based on the tainted size, but the allocation process itself does not introduce new taint.
- The return value (pointer to allocated memory) is tainted because it is intended to hold data copied from the tainted `params`.
- The taint propagates to the allocated memory, which is later used in the `write_persist_value` function.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `TEE_Malloc` function processes a tainted input that influences the size of memory allocation. While the function itself does not introduce new taint, the allocated memory is considered tainted and can lead to potential vulnerabilities if not handled properly in subsequent operations. Care should be taken to validate the size before allocation and to ensure that the tainted data is managed securely in later function calls.</pre>

To analyze the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> as they flow through the function.

To analyze the <code>TEE_Malloc</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>arg0</code> (which represents the size of the memory to be allocated) flows through this function. Since the implementation of <code>TEE_Malloc</code> is not provided, we will make reasonable assumptions based on typical memory allocation behavior in C.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>TEE_Malloc</code> is expected to allocate a block of memory of a specified size.

If <code>arg0</code> is tainted, the allocation size is influenced by potentially untrusted data.<br>   - The behavior of <code>TEE_Malloc</code> can vary based on its implementation, but typically:<br>     - If <code>arg0</code> is a valid size, it will allocate a block of memory and return a pointer to that memory.<br>     - If <code>arg0</code> is invalid (e.g., zero or excessively large), it may return <code>NULL</code> or trigger an error condition.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - The pointer returned by <code>TEE_Malloc</code> (let&#x27;s call it <code>allocated_memory</code>) will be tainted if the allocation is successful.

This does not propagate taint but indicates that the allocation based on tainted data was unsuccessful.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Propagation<br>- The tainted input <code>arg0</code> (size for memory allocation) propagates through the <code>TEE_Malloc</code> function.<br>- If the allocation is successful, the returned pointer (<code>allocated_memory</code>) is tainted because it is based on tainted input.<br>- If the allocation fails, the function handles the error, but the attempt to allocate memory based on tainted data is still significant.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the <code>TEE_Malloc</code> function propagates taint from the tainted input <code>arg0</code> to the allocated memory pointer. The taint status of the pointer returned by <code>TEE_Malloc</code> depends on the validity of the size argument. If the allocation is successful, the tainted pointer can lead to potential sinks in subsequent operations, where the tainted data may be exposed or processed. Care must be taken in the handling of this memory to ensure that security vulnerabilities are not introduced.

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes the following parameters:
- `void *sess`: Unused session parameter.
- `uint32_t cmd`: Command identifier.
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters.

### Tainted Parameters
- `&lt;param_types&gt;`: This is not explicitly passed to the function, but it is implied that the command may depend on the types of parameters in `params`.
- `&lt;params&gt;`: This is the main tainted parameter, as it is an array of `TEE_Param` structures that can contain user-controlled data.

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `params` array is tainted upon entry to the function. Any data within this array is considered tainted.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of `cmd`. The control flow is dependent on the value of `cmd`, which is not tainted but determines how the tainted `params` are used.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `read_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - The `params` array is passed directly to this function, maintaining its taint.
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `write_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Again, the `params` array is passed directly, propagating the taint.
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `delete_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - The `params` array is passed directly, continuing the taint propagation.
   - **Default Case**:
     - Logs an error message using `EMSG`, which does not involve tainted data directly but may log the `cmd` value.

4. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `params` array is a pointer to an array of `TEE_Param` structures. If any of these structures are modified within the called functions (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`), the taint will propagate to those modifications.
   - If any of the functions modify the contents of `params`, those modifications will also be tainted.

5. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The taint from `params` is propagated to the return values of the called functions. If any of these functions return a result based on the tainted data, the result will also be tainted.
   - The return value of `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` is influenced by the tainted data in `params` through the called functions.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- The `params` array is tainted upon entry.
- The taint is propagated through the function calls in the switch statement.
- The taint remains in the context of the function and is passed to the called functions, which may further manipulate or return tainted data.
- There are no explicit assignments that create new tainted variables, but the taint is carried through function calls.

### Conclusion
The `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function effectively propagates tainted data from the `params` array through its control flow and into the called functions. Care should be taken in those functions to handle the tainted data appropriately to avoid security vulnerabilities.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: write_persist_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `write_persist_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `write_persist_value` takes the following parameters:
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters, which is tainted.

### Tainted Input
- The `params` array is tainted, specifically:
  - `params[0]`: Contains a memory reference for the name.
  - `params[1]`: Contains a memory reference for the value.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `params` array is tainted upon entry to the function. Specifically, `params[0].memref.buffer` and `params[1].memref.buffer` are tainted.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function first checks if the parameter type `pt` matches the expected type `exp_pt`. If it does not match, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`, and no taint propagation occurs.

3. **Tainted Data Usage**:
   - **Name Buffer**:
     - `name_buf` is assigned from `params[0].memref.buffer`, which is tainted. Therefore, `name_buf` is also tainted.
     - `name_buf_sz` is assigned from `params[0].memref.size`, which is not tainted but is used to determine the size of the tainted data.
   - **Value Buffer**:
     - `value_sz` is assigned from `params[1].memref.size`, which is not tainted.
     - `value` is allocated using `TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)`. If the allocation fails, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`, and no taint propagation occurs.
     - If allocation is successful, `value` is tainted because it will eventually hold data copied from `params[1].memref.buffer`.

4. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The function uses `TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz);` to copy the contents of the tainted `params[1].memref.buffer` into the tainted `value`. This operation propagates the taint from `params[1]` to `value`.
   - The `value` variable is now tainted and will be used in subsequent operations.

5. **Conditional Logic**:
   - The function checks if `name_buf` starts with a vendor prefix or the `ROLLBACK_PROT` string. If it does, the `overwrite` flag is set to `false`. This logic does not affect taint propagation but controls whether the subsequent write operations can proceed.
   - The function then checks if `name_buf` matches `BOOTFIRM_VER`. If it does not, it calls `write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite);`. Here, both `name_buf` and `value` are tainted, so the call to `write_value` will also operate on tainted data.
   - If `name_buf` matches `BOOTFIRM_VER`, it calls `increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz);`, which also operates on tainted data.

6. **Sinks**:
   - The function calls `write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware`, both of which are potential sinks for tainted data. If these functions perform operations that depend on the tainted data (e.g., writing to persistent storage), then the taint reaches a sink.
   - The function returns `res`, which may be influenced by the tainted data if any of the called functions modify the state based on the tainted inputs.

7. **Memory Management**:
   - The allocated `value` is freed at the end of the function using `TEE_Free(value);`. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- The `params` array is tainted upon entry.
- The taint propagates to `name_buf` and `value` through assignments and memory operations.
- The taint is further propagated to the calls to `write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware`, which are potential sinks for the tainted data.
- The function may return a result influenced by the tainted data, depending on the operations performed in the called functions.

### Conclusion
The `write_persist_value` function effectively propagates tainted data from the `params` array through its control flow and into the called functions. Care should be taken in those functions to handle the tainted data appropriately to avoid security vulnerabilities.</pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: increase_boot_firmware</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `increase_boot_firmware` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `new_ver_str` (which is derived from the previous function `write_persist_value`) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `increase_boot_firmware` takes the following parameters:
- `char *new_ver_str`: A pointer to a string representing the new boot firmware version, which is tainted.
- `uint32_t new_ver_sz`: The size of the new version string, which is not tainted.

### Tainted Input
- The `new_ver_str` is tainted because it is derived from the `value` variable in the `write_persist_value` function, which was populated from the tainted `params[1].memref.buffer`.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `new_ver_str` is tainted upon entry to the function, as it is directly passed from the previous function where it was populated with potentially user-controlled data.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function first checks if the system is in a rollback-protected state by calling `is_rollback_protected()`. This function&#x27;s return value does not affect taint propagation but determines whether the next check is performed.
   - The function then checks if the new version string is incremental by calling `is_version_incremental(new_ver_str, new_ver_sz)`. This function takes the tainted `new_ver_str` as input, meaning that the taint is propagated into this function call.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - If the conditions for rollback protection and version increment are not met, the function logs an error message using `EMSG(&quot;Boot firmware version update is not permitted&quot;);`. This does not involve tainted data directly but indicates that the function may not proceed with the update.
   - If the conditions are met, the function calls `write_value(BOOTFIRM_VER, strlen(BOOTFIRM_VER) + 1, new_ver_str, new_ver_sz, true);`. Here, `new_ver_str` is tainted, and it is passed to `write_value`, which is a potential sink for tainted data.

4. **Sinks**:
   - The call to `write_value` is a critical point where tainted data reaches a sink. If `write_value` performs operations that depend on the tainted `new_ver_str`, such as writing to persistent storage or modifying system state, then the taint has reached a sink.
   - The function returns the result of the `write_value` call, which may be influenced by the tainted data.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- The `new_ver_str` is tainted upon entry to the function.
- The taint is propagated through the call to `is_version_incremental`, which takes the tainted data as input.
- If the conditions are met, the taint is further propagated to the call to `write_value`, which is a potential sink for the tainted data.
- The function may return a result influenced by the tainted data, depending on the operations performed in `write_value`.

### Conclusion
The `increase_boot_firmware` function effectively propagates tainted data from the previous function through its control flow and into the `write_value` function. Care should be taken in `write_value` to handle the tainted data appropriately to avoid security vulnerabilities. The taint analysis indicates that the function has potential security implications, especially if the tainted data is used to modify critical system parameters or state.</pre>

<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: is_rollback_protected</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `is_rollback_protected` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input (in this case, the context of the previous function&#x27;s operations) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `is_rollback_protected` does not take any parameters but operates on internal variables and calls another function, `read_value`.

### Tainted Input
- The function does not directly receive tainted input as parameters. However, it is called in the context of the `increase_boot_firmware` function, which uses tainted data (`new_ver_str`) to determine whether to proceed with the firmware update. Thus, the context of taint is relevant here.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - The function initializes a local variable `res` to `TEE_SUCCESS`, which is not tainted.
   - It also initializes `value_sz` to `MAX_SIMPLE_VALUE_SIZE` and declares a local array `value` of that size. These variables are not tainted.

2. **Reading Rollback Protection Value**:
   - The function calls `read_value(ROLLBACK_PROT, strlen(ROLLBACK_PROT) + 1, value, value_sz, &amp;count);`. 
   - The `ROLLBACK_PROT` string is a constant and not tainted. However, the `value` array is used to store the result of this read operation, which may contain sensitive data related to rollback protection.
   - The `res` variable will be set based on the success or failure of the `read_value` call. If the read operation is successful, `res` will be `TEE_SUCCESS`, indicating that rollback protection is enabled.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The function does not propagate taint from external sources since it does not directly use any tainted data. However, the outcome of the `read_value` function may depend on the state of the system, which could be influenced by previous tainted operations.
   - If `read_value` retrieves data that is influenced by tainted operations (e.g., if the rollback protection status is based on user-controlled data), then the implications of that data could be considered tainted in a broader context.

4. **Control Flow**:
   - If `res` is `TEE_SUCCESS`, the function logs a message indicating that rollback protection is enabled and returns `true`. This does not involve tainted data directly.
   - If `res` is not `TEE_SUCCESS`, the function returns `false`, indicating that rollback protection is not enabled.

5. **Sinks**:
   - The function itself does not reach any sinks in the traditional sense (e.g., writing to persistent storage or modifying system state). However, the outcome of this function (whether it returns `true` or `false`) can influence the control flow in the calling function (`increase_boot_firmware`), which may lead to further operations that could involve tainted data.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- The `is_rollback_protected` function does not directly handle tainted data but operates in a context where the outcome of its execution can influence the flow of tainted data in the calling function.
- The function calls `read_value`, which may interact with data that could be influenced by previous tainted operations, but the function itself does not propagate taint.
- The function does not reach any sinks directly, but its return value can affect subsequent operations in the call chain.

### Conclusion
The `is_rollback_protected` function does not propagate tainted data directly, as it does not take any parameters or use any external tainted inputs. However, it operates in a context where its outcome can influence the flow of tainted data in the calling function. The analysis indicates that while this function is not a direct sink for tainted data, its return value can impact the handling of tainted data in subsequent operations, particularly in the `increase_boot_firmware` function. Care should be taken to ensure that the logic surrounding rollback protection is secure and does not inadvertently allow unauthorized changes based on tainted data.</pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: read_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `read_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `read_value` takes the following parameters:
- `char *name`: A pointer to a string representing the name of the object to read.
- `uint32_t name_sz`: The size of the name string.
- `char *value`: A pointer to a buffer where the read value will be stored.
- `uint32_t value_sz`: The size of the buffer for the value.
- `uint32_t *count`: A pointer to a variable that will hold the number of bytes read.

### Tainted Input
- The `name` parameter is derived from the `ROLLBACK_PROT` constant in the context of the previous function (`is_rollback_protected`). It is not tainted.
- The `value` parameter is a buffer that will be populated with data read from persistent storage. This buffer is not tainted upon entry but will be populated with data that may be influenced by previous tainted operations.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - The function initializes a local variable `res` to `TEE_SUCCESS`, which is not tainted.
   - It also initializes `flags` to specify read and write access for the persistent object. These flags are not tainted.

2. **Getting the Full Object Name**:
   - The function calls `get_named_object_name(name, name_sz, name_full, &amp;name_full_sz);`. 
   - The `name` parameter is not tainted, so the result of this function call does not propagate any taint. If `res` is not `TEE_SUCCESS`, the function returns early, and no further operations occur.

3. **Opening the Persistent Object**:
   - The function calls `TEE_OpenPersistentObject(storageid, name_full, name_full_sz, flags, &amp;h);`. 
   - If this call fails (i.e., `res` is not `TEE_SUCCESS`), it logs an error message and returns early. Again, no taint propagation occurs here.

4. **Reading Object Data**:
   - The function calls `TEE_ReadObjectData(h, value, value_sz, count);`. 
   - The `value` buffer is where the data read from the persistent object will be stored. This operation is critical because it may populate the `value` buffer with data that could be influenced by previous tainted operations.
   - If this call fails, it logs an error message but does not propagate taint. If it succeeds, the `value` buffer now contains data that may be tainted, depending on the state of the persistent storage.

5. **Closing the Object**:
   - The function calls `TEE_CloseObject(h);` to close the persistent object handle. This operation does not affect taint propagation.

6. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `res`, which indicates the success or failure of the read operation. The return value itself is not tainted, but the contents of the `value` buffer may be tainted if the read operation was successful.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- The `name` parameter is not tainted, and thus does not propagate taint.
- The `value` buffer is initially not tainted, but it will be populated with data from the persistent storage, which may be influenced by previous tainted operations.
- The critical operation that may introduce taint is the call to `TEE_ReadObjectData`, which reads data into the `value` buffer. If this data is influenced by tainted operations, the `value` buffer will be considered tainted after this operation.
- The function does not reach any sinks directly, but the data read into the `value` buffer could be used in subsequent operations that may be sinks.

### Conclusion
The `read_value` function does not directly propagate tainted data, as its parameters do not originate from tainted sources. However, the data read into the `value` buffer from persistent storage may be influenced by previous tainted operations, making it potentially tainted. The function&#x27;s return value indicates success or failure but does not carry taint itself. Care should be taken in subsequent operations that utilize the `value` buffer to ensure that any tainted data is handled appropriately to avoid security vulnerabilities.</pre>

<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: get_named_object_name</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `get_named_object_name` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `get_named_object_name` takes the following parameters:
- `char *name_orig`: A pointer to the original object name, which may be tainted.
- `uint32_t name_orig_size`: The size of the original object name.
- `char *name`: A pointer to a buffer where the concatenated name will be stored.
- `uint32_t *name_size`: A pointer to a variable that will hold the size of the concatenated name.

### Tainted Input
- The `name_orig` parameter is derived from the `name` parameter in the previous function (`read_value`). If `read_value` successfully reads data into the `value` buffer, then `name_orig` could be tainted based on the state of the persistent storage.
- The `name` buffer is initially empty and will be populated by this function.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - The function initializes a local variable `pref_len` to the length of the `named_value_prefix`. This variable is not tainted.

2. **Parameter Validation**:
   - The function checks if the combined size of `name_orig_size` and `pref_len` exceeds `TEE_OBJECT_ID_MAX_LEN`. If it does, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`. This check does not involve tainted data.

3. **Prefix Addition**:
   - The function uses `TEE_MemMove(name, named_value_prefix, pref_len);` to copy the prefix into the `name` buffer. This operation does not involve tainted data, so the `name` buffer is still not tainted at this point.

4. **Concatenation of Original Name**:
   - The function then uses `TEE_MemMove(name + pref_len, name_orig, name_orig_size);` to copy the contents of `name_orig` into the `name` buffer, starting after the prefix.
   - If `name_orig` is tainted (which it may be if it was populated from a tainted source), this operation will propagate the taint into the `name` buffer. After this operation, the `name` buffer will be considered tainted.

5. **Setting the Size**:
   - The function sets `*name_size` to the total size of the concatenated name (`name_orig_size + pref_len`). This operation does not affect taint propagation.

6. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `TEE_SUCCESS`, indicating that the operation was successful. The return value itself is not tainted.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- The `name_orig` parameter may be tainted if it was populated from a tainted source in the previous function.
- The `name` buffer is initially not tainted but becomes tainted after the call to `TEE_MemMove(name + pref_len, name_orig, name_orig_size);` if `name_orig` is tainted.
- The function does not reach any sinks directly, but the tainted `name` buffer will be used in subsequent operations (e.g., in the `TEE_OpenPersistentObject` call in `read_value`), which may be sinks.

### Conclusion
The `get_named_object_name` function effectively propagates tainted data from the `name_orig` parameter to the `name` buffer. If `name_orig` is tainted, the resulting `name` buffer will also be tainted after the concatenation operation. The function does not directly reach any sinks, but the tainted `name` buffer will be used in subsequent operations that may involve sensitive actions, such as accessing persistent storage. Care should be taken in those subsequent operations to ensure that any tainted data is handled appropriately to avoid security vulnerabilities.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_MemMove</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_MemMove` function in the context of taint data flow, we will consider how it operates on the parameters and how it may affect the taint status of the data being manipulated. Since the implementation of `TEE_MemMove` is not provided, we will focus on its expected behavior based on typical memory manipulation functions.

### Function Overview
`TEE_MemMove` is expected to copy a specified number of bytes from a source memory location to a destination memory location. The function signature is likely similar to the following:

```c
void TEE_MemMove(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);

### Tainted Input
In the context of the previous functions, we have identified that:
- The `name_orig` parameter in `get_named_object_name` may be tainted if it was populated from a tainted source.
- The `name` buffer in `get_named_object_name` becomes tainted if `name_orig` is tainted after the call to `TEE_MemMove`.

### Taint Flow Analysis of TEE_MemMove

1. **Parameters Affected by Tainted Data**:
   - **arg0 (dest)**: This is the destination buffer where data will be copied. If this buffer is populated from a tainted source, it will be tainted after the operation.
   - **arg1 (src)**: This is the source buffer from which data will be copied. If this buffer is tainted, the data copied to the destination will also be tainted.
   - **arg2 (n)**: This is the number of bytes to copy. This parameter itself does not carry taint but determines how much data is affected.

2. **Taint Propagation**:
   - If `src` (arg1) is tainted, then after the execution of `TEE_MemMove`, the `dest` (arg0) will also be tainted. This is a direct propagation of taint.
   - If `src` is not tainted, then `dest` will remain untainted regardless of the operation, assuming that the operation does not introduce any new taint.

3. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `name` buffer in `get_named_object_name` is a destination for the `TEE_MemMove` operation. If `name_orig` is tainted, the `name` buffer will also be tainted after the operation.
   - If `name` is subsequently used in other functions (like `TEE_OpenPersistentObject`), any taint in `name` will propagate to those functions, potentially affecting their behavior and outputs.

4. **Potential Sinks**:
   - If the `name` buffer (which may be tainted) is used in a function that interacts with persistent storage or system state (like `TEE_OpenPersistentObject`), it could lead to security vulnerabilities if the tainted data is not properly validated or sanitized.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- The `TEE_MemMove` function is a critical point for taint propagation. If the source buffer (`src`) is tainted, the destination buffer (`dest`) will also become tainted after the operation.
- The parameters affected by tainted data are:
  - **arg0 (dest)**: Becomes tainted if `src` is tainted.
  - **arg1 (src)**: If tainted, it directly influences the taint status of `dest`.
  - **arg2 (n)**: Does not carry taint but determines the extent of the operation.

### Conclusion
The `TEE_MemMove` function is essential for understanding how taint propagates through memory operations. It is crucial to ensure that any data being copied is properly validated to prevent tainted data from reaching sensitive operations or sinks. In the context of the previous functions, care should be taken to ensure that any tainted data in `name_orig` does not lead to unintended consequences when used in subsequent operations. Proper validation and sanitization of data before it is used in critical functions are necessary to maintain security.</pre>

To analyze the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>sess</code>: A session pointer (unused in this function).<br>- <code>cmd</code>: A command identifier (of type <code>uint32_t</code>).<br>- <code>pt</code>: A parameter type (of type <code>uint32_t</code>).<br>- <code>params</code>: An array of <code>TEE_Param</code> structures (of size <code>TEE_NUM_PARAMS</code>).<br><br>### Tainted Parameters<br>- <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code>: This parameter is not explicitly passed to the function but is likely related to the <code>params</code> array.<br>- <code>&lt;params&gt;</code>: This is the main tainted parameter we will track.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - The <code>params</code> array is tainted upon entry into the function. Any data within this array is considered tainted.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function uses a <code>switch</code> statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of <code>cmd</code>. The control flow is dependent on the value of <code>cmd</code>, which is not tainted directly but can influence the execution path.<br><br>3. **Case Analysis**:<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>read_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - The <code>params</code> array is passed directly to this function, propagating the taint.<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>write_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Again, the <code>params</code> array is passed directly, propagating the taint.<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>delete_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - The <code>params</code> array is passed directly, propagating the taint.<br>   - **Default Case**:<br>     - If <code>cmd</code> does not match any of the cases, an error message is logged, and <code>TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED</code> is returned. No taint propagation occurs here.<br><br>4. **Data Aliases**:<br>   - The <code>params</code> array is a pointer to an array of <code>TEE_Param</code> structures. If any of these structures are modified within the called functions (<code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, <code>delete_persist_value</code>), the taint will propagate through those modifications.<br>   - If any of the functions modify the contents of <code>params</code>, those modifications will also be tainted.<br><br>5. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - The taint from <code>params</code> is propagated to the return values of the functions called within each case. If any of these functions return a result that depends on the tainted <code>params</code>, the result will also be tainted.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>params</code> array is tainted upon entry into <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>.<br>- The taint is propagated to the called functions based on the value of <code>cmd</code>.<br>- The taint remains through the function calls, and any modifications to <code>params</code> within those functions will continue to propagate the taint.<br>- The control flow based on <code>cmd</code> does not introduce new taint but determines which tainted data is processed.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis shows that the <code>params</code> array is the primary source of taint in the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function. The taint propagates through the function calls based on the command executed, and any modifications to the <code>params</code> array within those functions will maintain the taint. The function does not introduce new taint but relies on the tainted input to determine its behavior.

To analyze the <code>write_persist_value</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>params</code> (from the previous function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>write_persist_value</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>pt</code>: A parameter type (of type <code>uint32_t</code>).<br>- <code>params</code>: An array of <code>TEE_Param</code> structures (of size <code>TEE_NUM_PARAMS</code>).<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The <code>params</code> array is tainted as it is passed from the previous function. Specifically, <code>params[0]</code> and <code>params[1]</code> are of interest since they are used in the function.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - The <code>params</code> array is tainted upon entry into <code>write_persist_value</code>. Specifically, <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> and <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> are tainted.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function first checks if <code>pt</code> matches the expected parameter types (<code>exp_pt</code>). If it does not match, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>, and no taint propagation occurs.<br><br>3. **Tainted Data Usage**:<br>   - **Name Buffer**:<br>     - <code>name_buf</code> is assigned from <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code>, which is tainted. Therefore, <code>name_buf</code> is also tainted.<br>     - <code>name_buf_sz</code> is assigned from <code>params[0].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted but is used to determine the size of the tainted data.<br><br>4. **Validation Check**:<br>   - The function calls <code>check_valid_value(name_buf)</code>. If this function returns <code>TEE_SUCCESS</code>, it indicates that the tainted <code>name_buf</code> is valid. If it fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>. This does not propagate taint but checks the validity of the tainted data.<br><br>5. **Overwrite Logic**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with a vendor prefix or the <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code> string. If it does, the <code>overwrite</code> flag is set to <code>false</code>. This logic does not introduce new taint but uses the tainted <code>name_buf</code> to control the flow.<br><br>6. **Value Buffer**:<br>   - <code>value_sz</code> is assigned from <code>params[1].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted.<br>   - <code>value</code> is allocated using <code>TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)</code>. If the allocation fails, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY</code>, and no taint propagation occurs.<br><br>7. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - The function uses <code>TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)</code>. Here, the tainted data from <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> is copied into the <code>value</code> buffer. Thus, <code>value</code> becomes tainted.<br><br>8. **Conditional Logic**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with the vendor prefix and whether <code>CFG_FIOVB_VENDOR_CREATE</code> is enabled. If not, it sets <code>res</code> to <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code> and logs an error message. This does not propagate taint but controls the flow based on tainted data.<br>   - If <code>name_buf</code> does not match <code>BOOTFIRM_VER</code>, it calls <code>write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite)</code>. Here, both <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code> are tainted, so the call to <code>write_value</code> propagates the taint.<br>   - If <code>name_buf</code> matches <code>BOOTFIRM_VER</code>, it calls <code>increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz)</code>, where <code>value</code> is tainted.<br><br>9. **Memory Cleanup**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_Free(value)</code> to free the allocated memory for <code>value</code>. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.<br><br>10. **Return Value**:<br>    - The function returns <code>res</code>, which may be influenced by the tainted data if either <code>write_value</code> or <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> modifies the state based on the tainted inputs.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>params</code> array is tainted upon entry into <code>write_persist_value</code>.<br>- The taint propagates to <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code> through assignments and memory operations.<br>- The function checks the validity of the tainted <code>name_buf</code> but does not remove taint.<br>- Tainted data reaches potential sinks in the calls to <code>write_value</code> and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>, which may further process or store the tainted data.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis of <code>write_persist_value</code> shows that the function effectively propagates tainted data from the <code>params</code> array to local variables and potentially to external functions. The taint remains throughout the function, and the final return value may be influenced by the tainted inputs, especially in the context of the called functions.

To analyze the <code>is_rollback_protected</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input (in this case, the context of the taint from the previous function) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>is_rollback_protected</code> does not take any parameters. Instead, it checks whether rollback protection is enabled by reading a value associated with <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code>.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The tainted input in this context is indirectly related to the previous function&#x27;s tainted data (<code>new_ver_str</code> from <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>). However, since <code>is_rollback_protected</code> does not directly use any parameters, we will analyze how it interacts with the system state and whether it affects the taint flow.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial State**:<br>   - The function does not receive any tainted parameters directly. However, it is called in the context of a function (<code>increase_boot_firmware</code>) that processes tainted data. Therefore, the function&#x27;s behavior may be influenced by the tainted context.<br><br>2. **Reading Rollback Protection Value**:<br>   - The function calls <code>read_value(ROLLBACK_PROT, strlen(ROLLBACK_PROT) + 1, value, value_sz, &amp;count)</code>.<br>   - The <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code> string is a constant and not tainted. The function attempts to read a value associated with this key into the <code>value</code> buffer.<br>   - The result of this operation is stored in <code>res</code>. If <code>res</code> is <code>TEE_SUCCESS</code>, it indicates that rollback protection is enabled.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - Since <code>is_rollback_protected</code> does not directly use any tainted data (like <code>new_ver_str</code>), there is no new taint propagation within this function.<br>   - The function&#x27;s logic is based on the result of <code>read_value</code>, which may or may not depend on previously tainted data, but this is not directly observable in the function itself.<br><br>4. **Return Value**:<br>   - If <code>read_value</code> succeeds, the function logs a message indicating that rollback protection is enabled and returns <code>true</code>. If it fails, it returns <code>false</code>.<br>   - The return value does not propagate any taint; it simply indicates the state of rollback protection.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>is_rollback_protected</code> function does not directly handle any tainted input.<br>- There is no new taint propagation within this function since it does not use any parameters or variables that are tainted.<br>- The function interacts with the system state by reading a value associated with <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code>, but this does not involve tainted data.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis of <code>is_rollback_protected</code> shows that this function does not propagate tainted data. It operates independently of the tainted context established by previous functions. The function&#x27;s purpose is to check the state of rollback protection without introducing or modifying any taint. Therefore, it does not represent a sink for tainted data, and its return value is purely a boolean indicating the status of rollback protection.

We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>read_value</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>name</code>: A pointer to a character string representing the name of the object to read (tainted input).<br>- <code>name_sz</code>: The size of the name string (of type <code>uint32_t</code>).<br>- <code>value</code>: A pointer to a buffer where the read value will be stored (not tainted initially).<br>- <code>value_sz</code>: The size of the buffer for the value (of type <code>uint32_t</code>).<br>- <code>count</code>: A pointer to a variable that will hold the number of bytes read (not tainted initially).<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The <code>name</code> parameter is tainted as it is derived from the <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code> string in the context of the previous function calls. The taint originates from the context of the <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> function, which was influenced by the tainted <code>new_ver_str</code>.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - The <code>name</code> parameter is tainted upon entry into <code>read_value</code>. The <code>value</code> buffer is not tainted initially, but it will be populated with data read from the persistent storage.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function first calls <code>get_named_object_name(name, name_sz, name_full, &amp;name_full_sz)</code>.<br>   - The <code>name</code> parameter is passed directly to this function, propagating the taint. If <code>get_named_object_name</code> uses <code>name</code>, it will also be working with tainted data.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - If <code>get_named_object_name</code> returns an error, the function returns that error code, and no further taint propagation occurs.<br>   - If successful, the function proceeds to call <code>TEE_OpenPersistentObject(storageid, name_full, name_full_sz, flags, &amp;h)</code>. The <code>name_full</code> variable is populated by <code>get_named_object_name</code>, and if it contains any tainted data, it will also be tainted. However, since <code>name_full</code> is derived from <code>name</code>, it is also tainted.<br><br>4. **Reading Object Data**:<br>   - The function then calls <code>TEE_ReadObjectData(h, value, value_sz, count)</code>. This function attempts to read data from the persistent object identified by the handle <code>h</code> into the <code>value</code> buffer.<br>   - If <code>TEE_ReadObjectData</code> succeeds, the <code>value</code> buffer will now contain data that may be tainted, depending on the contents of the persistent object. If the persistent object was created or modified using tainted data, the data read into <code>value</code> will also be tainted.<br><br>5. **Error Handling**:<br>   - If <code>TEE_ReadObjectData</code> fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns the error code. This does not propagate taint but indicates a failure in reading the data.<br><br>6. **Closing the Object**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_CloseObject(h)</code> to close the persistent object handle. This does not affect taint propagation.<br><br>7. **Return Value**:<br>   - The function returns the result of the read operation (<code>res</code>). If the read was successful, the <code>value</code> buffer may now contain tainted data, depending on the state of the persistent object.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>name</code> parameter is tainted upon entry into <code>read_value</code>.<br>- The taint propagates through the function, particularly into the call to <code>get_named_object_name</code>, which may also process tainted data.<br>- If the read operation is successful, the <code>value</code> buffer will contain data that may be tainted, depending on the contents of the persistent object.<br>- The function does not introduce new taint but may propagate existing taint into the <code>value</code> buffer.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis of <code>read_value</code> shows that the function effectively propagates tainted data from the <code>name</code> parameter. The taint remains throughout the function, and if the read operation is successful, the <code>value</code> buffer may contain tainted data. This represents a potential sink for tainted data, as the contents of <code>value</code> could be used in subsequent operations, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

To analyze the <code>get_named_object_name</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input (specifically, the <code>name_orig</code> parameter) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>get_named_object_name</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>name_orig</code>: A pointer to a character string representing the original name of the object (tainted input).<br>- <code>name_orig_size</code>: The size of the original name string (of type <code>uint32_t</code>).<br>- <code>name</code>: A pointer to a buffer where the concatenated name will be stored (not tainted initially).<br>- <code>name_size</code>: A pointer to a variable that will hold the size of the concatenated name (not tainted initially).<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The <code>name_orig</code> parameter is tainted as it is derived from the previous function&#x27;s context, specifically from the <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code> string or any other tainted data that may have been passed through the call chain.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - The <code>name_orig</code> parameter is tainted upon entry into <code>get_named_object_name</code>. The <code>name</code> buffer is not tainted initially, but it will be populated with data derived from <code>name_orig</code>.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function first checks if the combined size of <code>name_orig</code> and the prefix (<code>named_value_prefix</code>) exceeds the maximum allowed length (<code>TEE_OBJECT_ID_MAX_LEN</code>). If it does, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>, and no further taint propagation occurs.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - If the size check passes, the function uses <code>TEE_MemMove(name, named_value_prefix, pref_len)</code> to copy the prefix into the <code>name</code> buffer. This operation does not introduce any taint since <code>named_value_prefix</code> is a constant and not derived from tainted data.<br>   - The function then concatenates the provided object name by calling <code>TEE_MemMove(name + pref_len, name_orig, name_orig_size)</code>. Here, the tainted <code>name_orig</code> is copied into the <code>name</code> buffer, starting at the position after the prefix. This means that the <code>name</code> buffer now contains tainted data.<br><br>4. **Setting the Name Size**:<br>   - The function sets <code>*name_size</code> to the total size of the concatenated name (<code>name_orig_size + pref_len</code>). This operation does not affect taint propagation.<br><br>5. **Return Value**:<br>   - The function returns <code>TEE_SUCCESS</code>, indicating that the operation was successful. The <code>name</code> buffer now contains a concatenated string that includes tainted data.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>name_orig</code> parameter is tainted upon entry into <code>get_named_object_name</code>.<br>- The taint propagates through the function, particularly into the <code>name</code> buffer when <code>name_orig</code> is copied.<br>- The <code>name</code> buffer now contains tainted data after the function completes, which may be used in subsequent operations.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis of <code>get_named_object_name</code> shows that the function effectively propagates tainted data from the <code>name_orig</code> parameter into the <code>name</code> buffer. The taint remains throughout the function, and the final state of the <code>name</code> buffer contains tainted data that may be used in later operations, such as in the <code>read_value</code> function. This represents a potential sink for tainted data, as any subsequent use of the <code>name</code> buffer could lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

To analyze the <code>TEE_MemMove</code> function in the context of taint data flow, we will consider how it interacts with the parameters that may be affected by tainted data. Since the implementation of <code>TEE_MemMove</code> is not provided, we will focus on its expected behavior based on typical memory copy operations and how it relates to the taint analysis results from the previous functions.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The <code>TEE_MemMove</code> function is typically used to copy a block of memory from one location to another. It is important to note that this function can handle overlapping memory regions, which is a key aspect of its behavior.<br><br>### Tainted Data Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Parameters Affected by Tainted Data**:<br>   - In the context of the previous functions, we have identified that the following parameters may be affected by tainted data:<br>     - <code>arg0</code>: This could represent the destination buffer where data is being copied to.<br>     - <code>arg1</code>: This could represent the source buffer from which data is being copied.<br>     - <code>arg2</code>: This could represent the size of the data being copied.<br><br>2. **Tracking Tainted Data**:<br>   - **Source Buffer (<code>arg1</code>)**:<br>     - In the previous analysis, we noted that <code>name_orig</code> (tainted) is copied into the <code>name</code> buffer using <code>TEE_MemMove(name + pref_len, name_orig, name_orig_size)</code>. Here, <code>name_orig</code> is the source buffer (<code>arg1</code>), which is tainted.<br>     - If <code>name_orig</code> contains tainted data, then any data copied from it into the destination buffer will also be tainted.<br><br>   - **Destination Buffer (<code>arg0</code>)**:<br>     - The destination buffer in the first call to <code>TEE_MemMove</code> is <code>name</code>, which is initially empty but will contain the prefix followed by the tainted data after the second call.<br>     - After the second call to <code>TEE_MemMove</code>, the <code>name</code> buffer will contain a concatenated string that includes both the prefix and the tainted data from <code>name_orig</code>.<br><br>   - **Size of Data (<code>arg2</code>)**:<br>     - The size parameter in both calls to <code>TEE_MemMove</code> is derived from the lengths of the respective buffers being copied. In the first call, it is <code>pref_len</code>, and in the second call, it is <code>name_orig_size</code>.<br>     - The size parameter itself is not tainted, but it determines how much data is copied from the source to the destination.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - When <code>TEE_MemMove</code> is called with tainted data as the source buffer, the destination buffer will also become tainted after the operation.<br>   - In the context of the <code>get_named_object_name</code> function, after the execution of both <code>TEE_MemMove</code> calls, the <code>name</code> buffer will contain tainted data, which can be used in subsequent operations (e.g., in <code>read_value</code>).<br><br>4. **Potential Sinks**:<br>   - The <code>name</code> buffer, now containing tainted data, will be passed to the <code>read_value</code> function. This represents a potential sink for tainted data, as any operations performed on this buffer could lead to security vulnerabilities if the tainted data is not properly validated or sanitized.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>TEE_MemMove</code> function is critical in propagating tainted data from the source buffer (<code>name_orig</code>) to the destination buffer (<code>name</code>).<br>- The taint flows through the memory copy operations, ensuring that any tainted data in the source buffer affects the destination buffer.<br>- The final state of the <code>name</code> buffer contains tainted data, which may be used in subsequent operations, particularly in the <code>read_value</code> function.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the analysis of <code>TEE_MemMove</code> highlights its role in propagating tainted data through memory operations. The function&#x27;s behavior ensures that any tainted data in the source buffer will affect the destination buffer, which can lead to potential security risks if the tainted data is not handled appropriately in subsequent operations. The tracking of tainted data through these memory operations is crucial for understanding the overall security implications of the code.

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` flow through the function, identify any data aliases, note operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flow.

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes the following parameters:
- `void *sess`: Unused session parameter.
- `uint32_t cmd`: Command identifier.
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters that can be tainted.

### Tainted Parameters
- `&lt;param_types&gt;`: This is not explicitly passed in the function signature but is implied to be part of the `params` array.
- `&lt;params&gt;`: The `params` array is directly tainted as it is passed into the function.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `params` array is tainted upon entry into the function. This means that any data within `params` is considered tainted.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of `cmd`. The control flow is dependent on the value of `cmd`, which is not tainted directly but influences which function is called next.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `read_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - The `params` array is passed directly to this function, propagating the taint.
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `write_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Again, the `params` array is passed directly, propagating the taint.
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `delete_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - The `params` array is passed directly, propagating the taint.
   - **Default Case**:
     - Logs an error message if the command is not supported. The command ID (`cmd`) is logged, but it does not affect the taint status of `params`.

4. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `params` array is a pointer to an array of `TEE_Param` structures. If any of these structures are modified within the called functions (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`), the taint will propagate through those modifications.
   - If any of the functions modify the contents of `params`, those modifications will also be tainted.

5. **Propagation of Taint**:
   - The taint is propagated through the function calls to `read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, and `delete_persist_value`. If any of these functions perform operations that depend on the contents of `params`, the taint will continue to propagate.
   - If any of these functions return a result that is based on the tainted `params`, that result will also be tainted.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- The `params` array is tainted upon entry into `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`.
- The taint propagates through the function calls based on the command (`cmd`) provided.
- The taint remains in the `params` array and can affect the behavior of the called functions.
- Any modifications to the `params` array or its contents in the called functions will retain the taint.

### Conclusion
The `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function effectively propagates taint from the `params` array to the called functions based on the command provided. Care should be taken in the implementation of `read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, and `delete_persist_value` to ensure that they handle tainted data appropriately.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: write_persist_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `write_persist_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`) flows through this function, identify any new taint propagation, and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Tainted Input
- The `params` array is tainted as it is passed from the previous function. Specifically, `params[0]` and `params[1]` are of interest since they are used in the function.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `params` array is tainted upon entry into `write_persist_value`. Specifically:
     - `params[0].memref.buffer` and `params[0].memref.size` are tainted.
     - `params[1].memref.buffer` and `params[1].memref.size` are also tainted.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function first checks if the parameter type (`pt`) matches the expected type (`exp_pt`). If it does not match, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`, and no further processing occurs. This check does not affect the taint status.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - **Name Buffer**:
     - `name_buf` is assigned from `params[0].memref.buffer`, which is tainted. Therefore, `name_buf` is also tainted.
     - `name_buf_sz` is assigned from `params[0].memref.size`, which is also tainted in the sense that it is derived from a tainted input.
   - **Validation Check**:
     - The function calls `check_valid_value(name_buf)`. If this function uses `name_buf` in a way that depends on its contents, any issues with the data could lead to a taint propagation. If the function returns `TEE_SUCCESS`, the taint remains.
   - **Overwrite Check**:
     - The checks against `vendor_prefix` and `ROLLBACK_PROT` do not affect the taint status but are conditional checks based on the contents of `name_buf`.
   - **Value Buffer**:
     - `value_sz` is assigned from `params[1].memref.size`, which is tainted.
     - `value` is allocated using `TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)`. If `value_sz` is derived from tainted data, the allocated memory is intended to hold tainted data.
     - `TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)` copies the contents from `params[1].memref.buffer` (tainted) to `value`. Thus, `value` is also tainted after this operation.

4. **Function Calls**:
   - The function then checks the contents of `name_buf` and calls either `write_value` or `increase_boot_firmware` based on the conditions:
     - If `write_value` is called, it receives `name_buf`, `name_buf_sz`, `value`, and `value_sz`. Since `name_buf` and `value` are tainted, the data passed to `write_value` is tainted.
     - If `increase_boot_firmware` is called, it receives `value`, which is also tainted.

5. **Memory Management**:
   - The allocated `value` is freed at the end of the function using `TEE_Free(value)`. This does not affect the taint status but is important for memory management.

6. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `res`, which can be influenced by the tainted data if any of the called functions (`write_value` or `increase_boot_firmware`) return an error based on the tainted inputs.

### Sinks
- The potential sinks in this function are:
  - The calls to `write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware`, which may perform operations based on the tainted data. If these functions write to persistent storage or perform sensitive operations, they are considered sinks for tainted data.
  - The logging statement `EMSG(&quot;Not found %s&quot;, name_buf)` could also be considered a sink if it logs sensitive information.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- The `params` array is tainted upon entry into `write_persist_value`.
- The taint propagates to `name_buf`, `name_buf_sz`, `value`, and `value_sz`.
- The function calls (`write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware`) receive tainted data, which could lead to further taint propagation or potential security issues if they handle sensitive data.
- The function does not sanitize or validate the contents of `name_buf` and `value` beyond the initial checks, which could lead to vulnerabilities if the data is not properly controlled.

### Conclusion
The `write_persist_value` function effectively propagates taint from the `params` array to its internal variables and through to the called functions. Care should be taken in the implementation of `write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware` to ensure that they handle tainted data appropriately and do not introduce security vulnerabilities.</pre>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To continue the taint analysis, we will focus on how tainted data from the `params` array can affect the parameters `arg0`, `arg1`, and `arg2` in the context of the `write_persist_value` function. We will track the flow of tainted data, identify any data aliases, and note any operations that propagate taint.

### Tainted Input Recap
- The `params` array is tainted upon entry into `write_persist_value`.
- Specifically:
  - `params[0].memref.buffer` (tainted) is assigned to `name_buf`.
  - `params[0].memref.size` (tainted) is assigned to `name_buf_sz`.
  - `params[1].memref.buffer` (tainted) is assigned to `value`.
  - `params[1].memref.size` (tainted) is assigned to `value_sz`.

### Taint Flow Analysis for Parameters `arg0`, `arg1`, and `arg2`

1. **Parameter Assignments**:
   - In the context of the `write_persist_value` function, we will assume that `arg0`, `arg1`, and `arg2` correspond to the following:
     - `arg0` = `name_buf` (from `params[0].memref.buffer`)
     - `arg1` = `value` (from `params[1].memref.buffer`)
     - `arg2` = `name_buf_sz` (from `params[0].memref.size`)

2. **Tracking Tainted Data**:
   - **arg0 (name_buf)**:
     - `name_buf` is directly assigned from `params[0].memref.buffer`, which is tainted. Therefore, `arg0` is tainted.
     - Any operations performed on `name_buf` (e.g., `strncmp`) will operate on tainted data.
   - **arg1 (value)**:
     - `value` is assigned from `params[1].memref.buffer`, which is tainted. Therefore, `arg1` is tainted.
     - The `TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)` operation copies tainted data into `value`, confirming that `arg1` is tainted.
   - **arg2 (name_buf_sz)**:
     - `name_buf_sz` is assigned from `params[0].memref.size`, which is tainted. Therefore, `arg2` is tainted.
     - This size is used in operations that may depend on the tainted data.

3. **Operations Affecting Tainted Data**:
   - The function uses `strncmp` to compare `name_buf` with `vendor_prefix` and `ROLLBACK_PROT`. Since `name_buf` is tainted, the comparison is also tainted. If the comparison results in a decision that affects control flow (e.g., whether to allow overwriting), this is an implicit flow of taint.
   - The `write_value` function is called with `arg0`, `arg1`, and `arg2`. Since all three parameters are tainted, any operations performed within `write_value` that depend on these parameters will also be tainted.

4. **Data Aliases**:
   - `name_buf` and `value` are pointers to buffers that hold tainted data. If any of these buffers are modified, the modifications will affect the tainted data.
   - The `params` array itself is a data structure that contains pointers to the buffers. Thus, any changes to the buffers pointed to by `params[0].memref.buffer` or `params[1].memref.buffer` will also affect the taint status.

5. **Potential Sinks**:
   - The `write_value` function is a potential sink for tainted data. If it writes to persistent storage or performs sensitive operations based on the tainted inputs, it could lead to security vulnerabilities.
   - The `EMSG` logging statements that use `name_buf` also represent a potential sink, as they may log sensitive information.

### Summary of Taint Flow for Parameters
- **arg0 (name_buf)**: Tainted from `params[0].memref.buffer`. Any operations on `name_buf` (e.g., `strncmp`) are tainted.
- **arg1 (value)**: Tainted from `params[1].memref.buffer`. The `TEE_MemMove` operation confirms the taint.
- **arg2 (name_buf_sz)**: Tainted from `params[0].memref.size`. Used in operations that may depend on tainted data.

### Conclusion
The `write_persist_value` function propagates taint from the `params` array to the parameters `arg0`, `arg1`, and `arg2`. All three parameters are tainted, and any operations performed on them or any functions called with these parameters (like `write_value`) will also be affected by the taint. Care should be taken in the implementation of `write_value` and any other functions that handle these parameters to ensure that they do not introduce security vulnerabilities by improperly handling tainted data.</pre>

To analyze the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flow.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>void *sess</code>: Unused session parameter.<br>- <code>uint32_t cmd</code>: Command identifier.<br>- <code>uint32_t pt</code>: Parameter type.<br>- <code>TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]</code>: Array of parameters that can be tainted.<br><br>### Tainted Parameters<br>- The parameters <code>pt</code> and <code>params</code> are considered tainted. The <code>params</code> array is particularly important as it can contain sensitive data that may be manipulated or used in subsequent operations.<br><br>### Data Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - <code>params</code> is tainted as it is passed directly into the function.<br>   - <code>pt</code> is also tainted, but its impact depends on how it is used in the function.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function uses a <code>switch</code> statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of <code>cmd</code>. The value of <code>cmd</code> is not tainted, but it controls which function is called next.<br><br>3. **Case Analysis**:<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>read_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Tainted data: <code>params</code> is passed directly, so any data within <code>params</code> remains tainted.<br>     - <code>pt</code> is also passed, but its effect on taint propagation depends on the implementation of <code>read_persist_value</code>.<br><br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>write_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Similar to the previous case, <code>params</code> remains tainted as it is passed directly.<br>     - <code>pt</code> is also passed, and its effect on taint propagation depends on the implementation of <code>write_persist_value</code>.<br><br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>delete_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Again, <code>params</code> remains tainted as it is passed directly.<br>     - The effect of <code>pt</code> on taint propagation depends on the implementation of <code>delete_persist_value</code>.<br><br>   - **Default Case**:<br>     - If <code>cmd</code> does not match any of the cases, an error message is logged, and <code>TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED</code> is returned. No tainted data is propagated in this case.<br><br>### Data Aliases<br>- The <code>params</code> array is a pointer to <code>TEE_Param</code> structures. If any of these structures are modified within the called functions (<code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, <code>delete_persist_value</code>), the taint will propagate to those modifications.<br>- If any of the functions modify the contents of <code>params</code>, the taint will persist in those modifications.<br><br>### Operations Propagating Taint<br>- The direct passing of <code>params</code> to the three command functions (<code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, <code>delete_persist_value</code>) propagates the taint.<br>- If any of these functions perform assignments or modifications to the <code>params</code> array or its elements, the taint will propagate further.<br><br>### Implicit Flow<br>- The control flow through the <code>switch</code> statement is dependent on the value of <code>cmd</code>. If <code>cmd</code> is influenced by external tainted data, it could lead to different paths being taken, which may affect the overall security of the function.<br><br>### Summary<br>- The tainted parameters <code>params</code> and <code>pt</code> are passed to three different functions based on the value of <code>cmd</code>.<br>- The <code>params</code> array remains tainted throughout the function and can propagate taint to the called functions.<br>- The control flow based on <code>cmd</code> can lead to different handling of tainted data, depending on the implementation of the called functions.<br>- Care should be taken in the implementations of <code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, and <code>delete_persist_value</code> to ensure that tainted data is handled securely.

To analyze the <code>write_persist_value</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>params</code> (specifically <code>params[0]</code> and <code>params[1]</code>) flows through the function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>write_persist_value</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>uint32_t pt</code>: Parameter type.<br>- <code>TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]</code>: Array of parameters, where <code>params[0]</code> is expected to be a memory reference for the name and <code>params[1]</code> is expected to be a memory reference for the value.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The <code>params</code> array is tainted as it is passed from the previous function (<code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>).<br>- Specifically, <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> (the name) and <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> (the value) are the key areas of interest for taint propagation.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - <code>params[0]</code> and <code>params[1]</code> are tainted as they are passed into the function.<br>   - The function checks the parameter type <code>pt</code> against an expected value (<code>exp_pt</code>). If <code>pt</code> does not match, the function returns early with <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>, and no taint propagation occurs.<br><br>2. **Tainted Data Usage**:<br>   - <code>name_buf</code> is assigned from <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code>, which is tainted. Therefore, <code>name_buf</code> is also tainted.<br>   - <code>name_buf_sz</code> is assigned from <code>params[0].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted but is used to determine the size of the tainted buffer.<br><br>3. **Validation Check**:<br>   - The function calls <code>check_valid_value(name_buf)</code>. If this function uses <code>name_buf</code> in a way that could lead to a security issue (e.g., logging or processing), the taint is propagated. If it returns <code>TEE_SUCCESS</code>, the function continues; otherwise, it logs an error and returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>.<br><br>4. **Overwrite Logic**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with a vendor prefix or a rollback protection string. If it does, the <code>overwrite</code> flag is set to <code>false</code>. This logic does not affect taint propagation but is important for security checks.<br><br>5. **Memory Allocation**:<br>   - <code>value_sz</code> is assigned from <code>params[1].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted. However, it is used to allocate memory for <code>value</code> using <code>TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)</code>. If <code>value_sz</code> is derived from tainted data, the allocation could be influenced by tainted input.<br>   - If the allocation fails, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY</code>, and no taint propagation occurs.<br><br>6. **Copying Tainted Data**:<br>   - The function uses <code>TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)</code>. Here, <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> is tainted, and thus <code>value</code> becomes tainted as it copies the contents of the tainted buffer into a new location.<br><br>7. **Conditional Logic**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with a vendor prefix and whether vendor creation is enabled. If not, it sets <code>res</code> to <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code> and logs an error. This does not propagate taint but is a security check.<br>   - If <code>name_buf</code> does not match the boot firmware version, it calls <code>write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite)</code>. Here, both <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code> are tainted, so the taint propagates to this function call.<br>   - If it matches the boot firmware version, it calls <code>increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz)</code>, where <code>value</code> is tainted.<br><br>8. **Freeing Memory**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_Free(value)</code>, which does not affect taint propagation but is important for memory management.<br><br>9. **Return Value**:<br>   - The function returns <code>res</code>, which may indicate success or failure based on the operations performed. If any of the operations involved tainted data, the result could be influenced by that taint.<br><br>### Sinks<br>- The potential sinks in this function are:<br>  - The logging of <code>name_buf</code> in the <code>EMSG</code> calls, which could expose tainted data if the checks fail.<br>  - The calls to <code>write_value</code> and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>, which may perform operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities if they handle tainted data improperly.<br><br>### Summary<br>- The tainted input <code>params</code> flows through the <code>write_persist_value</code> function, with <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code> being the primary carriers of taint.<br>- Taint is propagated through memory allocation and data copying operations.<br>- The function contains security checks that prevent certain operations based on the content of <code>name_buf</code>, but it also has potential sinks where tainted data could be logged or processed.<br>- Care should be taken in the implementations of <code>check_valid_value</code>, <code>write_value</code>, and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> to ensure that tainted data is handled securely.

To continue the taint analysis, we will focus on how tainted data can affect the parameters <code>arg0</code>, <code>arg1</code>, and <code>arg2</code> in the context of the <code>write_persist_value</code> function. We will track the flow of tainted data through the function, paying special attention to data aliases and operations that propagate taint.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The <code>write_persist_value</code> function processes two main parameters from the <code>params</code> array:<br>- <code>params[0]</code> (alias <code>arg0</code>): Expected to be a memory reference containing the name.<br>- <code>params[1]</code> (alias <code>arg1</code>): Expected to be a memory reference containing the value.<br>- <code>params[2]</code> (alias <code>arg2</code>): Not used in this function, but we will consider its potential impact if it were to be used in future calls.<br><br>### Tainted Data Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - <code>params[0]</code> (alias <code>arg0</code>) is tainted as it is passed from the previous function. Specifically, <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> is tainted and assigned to <code>name_buf</code>.<br>   - <code>params[1]</code> (alias <code>arg1</code>) is also tainted, with <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> being assigned to <code>value</code> after memory allocation.<br><br>2. **Tainted Data Operations**:<br>   - **Name Buffer (<code>arg0</code>)**:<br>     - The <code>name_buf</code> variable is directly assigned from <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code>, making it tainted.<br>     - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with a vendor prefix or a rollback protection string using <code>strncmp</code>. This operation does not modify <code>name_buf</code> but uses it in a comparison, which could lead to security issues if the comparison is logged or affects control flow.<br>     - If <code>check_valid_value(name_buf)</code> returns an error, it logs the tainted <code>name_buf</code> and returns an error code. This is a potential sink for tainted data.<br><br>   - **Value Buffer (<code>arg1</code>)**:<br>     - The <code>value</code> variable is assigned from <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> after a successful memory allocation. This means <code>value</code> is also tainted.<br>     - The function uses <code>TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)</code> to copy the contents of the tainted buffer into <code>value</code>. This operation propagates the taint to <code>value</code>.<br>     - The <code>value</code> is then used in the calls to <code>write_value</code> and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>, both of which could be sinks for tainted data.<br><br>3. **Unused Parameter (<code>arg2</code>)**:<br>   - <code>params[2]</code> (alias <code>arg2</code>) is not used in the <code>write_persist_value</code> function. However, if it were to be used in future modifications of the function, it could potentially be affected by tainted data if the function were to include logic that references <code>params[2]</code>.<br><br>### Summary of Tainted Data Flow<br>- **<code>arg0</code> (params[0])**:<br>  - Tainted data flows from <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> to <code>name_buf</code>.<br>  - The taint is propagated through the <code>check_valid_value</code> function and the <code>strncmp</code> checks.<br>  - If any of these checks log or process <code>name_buf</code>, it could lead to exposure of tainted data.<br><br>- **<code>arg1</code> (params[1])**:<br>  - Tainted data flows from <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> to <code>value</code>.<br>  - The taint is propagated through the <code>TEE_MemMove</code> operation.<br>  - The <code>value</code> is then used in subsequent function calls (<code>write_value</code> and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>), which could be sinks for tainted data.<br><br>- **<code>arg2</code> (params[2])**:<br>  - Not used in this function, but if it were to be referenced in future modifications, it could potentially be affected by tainted data if the function logic were to change.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>The <code>write_persist_value</code> function effectively propagates tainted data from its input parameters to local variables and potentially to external function calls. The analysis highlights the importance of careful handling of tainted data, especially in logging and external function calls, to prevent security vulnerabilities. Future modifications to the function should consider the implications of using <code>params[2]</code> and ensure that all paths maintain data integrity and security.

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flow.

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes the following parameters:
- `void *sess`: Unused session parameter.
- `uint32_t cmd`: Command identifier.
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters that can be tainted.

### Tainted Parameters
- The parameters `pt` and `params` are considered tainted. The `params` array is particularly important as it can contain multiple values that may be influenced by external input.

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - `params` is an array of `TEE_Param`, which can contain multiple fields that may be tainted.
   - `pt` is a `uint32_t` that may also be influenced by external input.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of `cmd`.
   - The value of `cmd` is not tainted directly, but it controls which function is called next, thus creating an implicit flow based on the value of `cmd`.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `read_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Tainted parameters: `pt` and `params` are passed to this function, propagating taint.
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `write_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Tainted parameters: `pt` and `params` are passed, propagating taint.
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `delete_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Tainted parameters: `pt` and `params` are passed, propagating taint.
   - **Default Case**:
     - Logs an error message with `cmd`, but does not propagate taint since it does not call any other function.

4. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `params` array is a pointer to `TEE_Param`, which means that any modifications to the elements of `params` in the called functions (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`) will affect the original `params` array.
   - If any of these functions modify the contents of `params`, the taint will propagate to those modified fields.

5. **Operations Propagating Taint**:
   - The calls to `read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, and `delete_persist_value` are critical points where taint can propagate. If these functions perform operations that read from or write to `params`, the taint will continue to flow through the system.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The parameters `pt` and `params` are tainted upon entry to `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`.
- The `switch` statement controls which command is executed, but does not directly affect taint.
- Each case calls a function that takes `pt` and `params`, propagating taint to those functions.
- Any modifications to `params` within those functions will retain the taint, as they are operating on the original data.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the taint analysis shows that the parameters `pt` and `params` are tainted upon entry and remain tainted as they are passed to other functions. The potential for data aliasing exists due to the nature of pointers and arrays in C, and any modifications to `params` in the called functions will propagate the taint. The control flow through the `switch` statement does not directly affect the taint but determines which functions are called, thus influencing the overall data flow.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: write_persist_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `write_persist_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (specifically `params[0]` and `params[1]`) flows through the function. We will identify any new taint propagation, check if tainted data reaches any sinks, and note any operations that may affect the taint status.

### Function Overview
The function `write_persist_value` takes the following parameters:
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters, where `params[0]` and `params[1]` are expected to be memory references.

### Tainted Input
- The `params` array is tainted from the previous function (`TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`).
- Specifically, `params[0]` and `params[1]` are of type `TEE_Param`, which contains a `memref` structure that includes a buffer and size.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - `params[0].memref.buffer` and `params[1].memref.buffer` are tainted as they are derived from the tainted `params` array.
   - The sizes `params[0].memref.size` and `params[1].memref.size` are also tainted.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function first checks if `pt` matches the expected parameter type (`exp_pt`). If it does not match, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`, and no further processing occurs. This check does not affect taint propagation.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - **Name Buffer**:
     - `name_buf` is assigned from `params[0].memref.buffer`, which is tainted. Therefore, `name_buf` is also tainted.
     - `name_buf_sz` is assigned from `params[0].memref.size`, which is tainted.
   - **Value Buffer**:
     - `value_sz` is assigned from `params[1].memref.size`, which is tainted.
     - `value` is allocated using `TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)`. If `value_sz` is tainted, the allocation size is influenced by tainted data.
     - `TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)` copies data from the tainted `params[1].memref.buffer` to the tainted `value`. Thus, `value` is also tainted.

4. **Validation Check**:
   - The function calls `check_valid_value(name_buf)`, which checks the validity of the `name_buf`. If this function uses `name_buf` in a way that could lead to a security issue (e.g., logging or processing), it could be considered a sink for tainted data.
   - If `check_valid_value` returns an error, an error message is logged with `EMSG(&quot;Not found %s&quot;, name_buf)`, which could expose tainted data if `name_buf` is logged.

5. **Overwrite Logic**:
   - The function checks if `name_buf` starts with a vendor prefix or a rollback protection string. If it does, the `overwrite` flag is set to `false`. This logic does not affect taint but is important for the function&#x27;s behavior.

6. **Writing Values**:
   - The function calls `write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite)` if the conditions are met. This function is a potential sink for tainted data, as it uses `name_buf` and `value`, both of which are tainted.
   - If the `name_buf` matches `BOOTFIRM_VER`, it calls `increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz)`, which is another potential sink for tainted data.

7. **Memory Management**:
   - The allocated `value` is freed at the end of the function with `TEE_Free(value)`. This does not affect taint but is important for resource management.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The tainted input `params` propagates through the function, affecting `name_buf`, `value`, and their respective sizes.
- The function contains potential sinks where tainted data could be exposed or processed: 
  - The call to `check_valid_value(name_buf)` could log tainted data.
  - The calls to `write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware` use tainted data, which could lead to security issues if not handled properly.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `write_persist_value` function successfully propagates tainted data from the `params` array to various local variables and potential sinks. The function&#x27;s logic and checks do not eliminate the taint, and care must be taken to ensure that the tainted data is handled securely in subsequent operations.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_Malloc</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_Malloc` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `arg0` (which represents the size of the memory to be allocated) flows through this function. Since the implementation of `TEE_Malloc` is not provided, we will make reasonable assumptions based on typical memory allocation behavior in C.

### Function Overview
The function `TEE_Malloc` is expected to allocate a block of memory of a specified size. The tainted input `arg0` is the size of the memory to be allocated, which is derived from the tainted parameter `params[1].memref.size` in the previous function (`write_persist_value`).

### Tainted Input
- The tainted input `arg0` is the size of the memory to be allocated, which is derived from `params[1].memref.size`. This value is tainted because it originates from user-controlled input.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - `arg0` (the size argument for `TEE_Malloc`) is tainted as it comes from the tainted `params[1].memref.size`.

2. **Memory Allocation**:
   - The `TEE_Malloc` function is expected to allocate memory based on the size provided by `arg0`. If `arg0` is tainted, the allocation size is influenced by potentially untrusted data.
   - The behavior of `TEE_Malloc` can vary based on its implementation, but typically:
     - If `arg0` is a valid size, it will allocate a block of memory and return a pointer to that memory.
     - If `arg0` is invalid (e.g., zero or excessively large), it may return `NULL` or trigger an error condition.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The pointer returned by `TEE_Malloc` (let&#x27;s call it `allocated_memory`) will be tainted if the allocation is successful. This is because the size of the allocation was derived from tainted data.
   - If `TEE_Malloc` returns `NULL`, the taint does not propagate further, but the fact that the allocation was attempted with tainted data is still significant.

4. **Potential Sinks**:
   - The tainted pointer `allocated_memory` will be used in subsequent operations (e.g., `TEE_MemMove` in the `write_persist_value` function). If this pointer is used in a way that exposes or processes the data, it could lead to security vulnerabilities.
   - If the allocated memory is later written to or read from, any data in that memory could be tainted, depending on how it is used.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - If `TEE_Malloc` fails (returns `NULL`), the calling function (`write_persist_value`) checks for this condition and returns an error (`TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`). This does not propagate taint but indicates that the allocation based on tainted data was unsuccessful.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The tainted input `arg0` (size for memory allocation) propagates through the `TEE_Malloc` function.
- If the allocation is successful, the returned pointer (`allocated_memory`) is tainted because it is based on tainted input.
- If the allocation fails, the function handles the error, but the attempt to allocate memory based on tainted data is still significant.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the `TEE_Malloc` function propagates taint from the tainted input `arg0` to the allocated memory pointer. The taint status of the pointer returned by `TEE_Malloc` depends on the validity of the size argument. If the allocation is successful, the tainted pointer can lead to potential sinks in subsequent operations, where the tainted data may be exposed or processed. Care must be taken in the handling of this memory to ensure that security vulnerabilities are not introduced.</pre>

To analyze the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flow.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>void *sess</code>: Unused session parameter.<br>- <code>uint32_t cmd</code>: Command identifier.<br>- <code>uint32_t pt</code>: Parameter type.<br>- <code>TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]</code>: Array of parameters that can be tainted.<br><br>### Tainted Parameters<br>- The parameters <code>pt</code> and <code>params</code> are considered tainted. The <code>params</code> array is particularly important as it can contain multiple values that may be influenced by external input.<br><br>### Data Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - <code>params</code> is an array of <code>TEE_Param</code>, which can contain multiple fields that may be tainted.<br>   - <code>pt</code> is a <code>uint32_t</code> that may also be influenced by external input.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function uses a <code>switch</code> statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of <code>cmd</code>.<br>   - The value of <code>cmd</code> is not tainted directly, but it controls which function is called next, thus creating an implicit flow based on the value of <code>cmd</code>.<br><br>3. **Case Analysis**:<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>read_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Tainted parameters: <code>pt</code> and <code>params</code> are passed to this function, propagating taint.<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>write_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Tainted parameters: <code>pt</code> and <code>params</code> are passed, propagating taint.<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>delete_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Tainted parameters: <code>pt</code> and <code>params</code> are passed, propagating taint.<br>   - **Default Case**:<br>     - Logs an error message with <code>cmd</code>, but does not propagate taint since it does not call any other function.<br><br>4. **Data Aliases**:<br>   - The <code>params</code> array is a pointer to <code>TEE_Param</code>, which means that any modifications to the elements of <code>params</code> in the called functions (<code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, <code>delete_persist_value</code>) will affect the original <code>params</code> array.<br>   - If any of these functions modify the contents of <code>params</code>, the taint will propagate to those modified fields.<br><br>5. **Operations Propagating Taint**:<br>   - The calls to <code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, and <code>delete_persist_value</code> are critical points where taint can propagate. If these functions perform operations that read from or write to <code>params</code>, the taint will continue to flow through the system.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Propagation<br>- The parameters <code>pt</code> and <code>params</code> are tainted upon entry to <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>.<br>- The <code>switch</code> statement controls which command is executed, but does not directly affect taint.<br>- Each case calls a function that takes <code>pt</code> and <code>params</code>, propagating taint to those functions.<br>- Any modifications to <code>params</code> within those functions will retain the taint, as they are operating on the original data.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis shows that the parameters <code>pt</code> and <code>params</code> are tainted upon entry and remain tainted as they are passed to other functions. The potential for data aliasing exists due to the nature of pointers and arrays in C, and any modifications to <code>params</code> in the called functions will propagate the taint. The control flow through the <code>switch</code> statement does not directly affect the taint but determines which functions are called, thus influencing the overall data flow.

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes the following parameters:
- `sess`: A session pointer (unused in this function).
- `cmd`: A command identifier (of type `uint32_t`).
- `pt`: A parameter type (of type `uint32_t`).
- `params`: An array of `TEE_Param` structures (of size `TEE_NUM_PARAMS`).

### Tainted Parameters
- `&lt;param_types&gt;`: This parameter is not explicitly passed to the function but is likely related to the `params` array.
- `&lt;params&gt;`: This is the main tainted parameter we will track.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `params` array is tainted upon entry into the function. Any data within this array is considered tainted.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of `cmd`. The control flow is dependent on the value of `cmd`, which is not tainted directly but can influence the execution path.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `read_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - The `params` array is passed directly to this function, propagating the taint.
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `write_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Again, the `params` array is passed directly, propagating the taint.
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `delete_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - The `params` array is passed directly, propagating the taint.
   - **Default Case**:
     - If `cmd` does not match any of the cases, an error message is logged, and `TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` is returned. No taint propagation occurs here.

4. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `params` array is a pointer to an array of `TEE_Param` structures. If any of these structures are modified within the called functions (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`), the taint will propagate through those modifications.
   - If any of the functions modify the contents of `params`, those modifications will also be tainted.

5. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The taint from `params` is propagated to the return values of the functions called within each case. If any of these functions return a result that depends on the tainted `params`, the result will also be tainted.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- The `params` array is tainted upon entry into `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`.
- The taint is propagated to the called functions based on the value of `cmd`.
- The taint remains through the function calls, and any modifications to `params` within those functions will continue to propagate the taint.
- The control flow based on `cmd` does not introduce new taint but determines which tainted data is processed.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the taint analysis shows that the `params` array is the primary source of taint in the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function. The taint propagates through the function calls based on the command executed, and any modifications to the `params` array within those functions will maintain the taint. The function does not introduce new taint but relies on the tainted input to determine its behavior.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: write_persist_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `write_persist_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `write_persist_value` takes the following parameters:
- `pt`: A parameter type (of type `uint32_t`).
- `params`: An array of `TEE_Param` structures (of size `TEE_NUM_PARAMS`).

### Tainted Input
- The `params` array is tainted as it is passed from the previous function. Specifically, `params[0]` and `params[1]` are of interest since they are used in the function.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `params` array is tainted upon entry into `write_persist_value`. Specifically, `params[0].memref.buffer` and `params[1].memref.buffer` are tainted.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function first checks if `pt` matches the expected parameter types (`exp_pt`). If it does not match, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`, and no taint propagation occurs.

3. **Tainted Data Usage**:
   - **Name Buffer**:
     - `name_buf` is assigned from `params[0].memref.buffer`, which is tainted. Therefore, `name_buf` is also tainted.
     - `name_buf_sz` is assigned from `params[0].memref.size`, which is not tainted but is used to determine the size of the tainted data.

4. **Validation Check**:
   - The function calls `check_valid_value(name_buf)`. If this function returns `TEE_SUCCESS`, it indicates that the tainted `name_buf` is valid. If it fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`. This does not propagate taint but checks the validity of the tainted data.

5. **Overwrite Logic**:
   - The function checks if `name_buf` starts with a vendor prefix or the `ROLLBACK_PROT` string. If it does, the `overwrite` flag is set to `false`. This logic does not introduce new taint but uses the tainted `name_buf` to control the flow.

6. **Value Buffer**:
   - `value_sz` is assigned from `params[1].memref.size`, which is not tainted.
   - `value` is allocated using `TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)`. If the allocation fails, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`, and no taint propagation occurs.

7. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The function uses `TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)`. Here, the tainted data from `params[1].memref.buffer` is copied into the `value` buffer. Thus, `value` becomes tainted.

8. **Conditional Logic**:
   - The function checks if `name_buf` starts with the vendor prefix and whether `CFG_FIOVB_VENDOR_CREATE` is enabled. If not, it sets `res` to `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS` and logs an error message. This does not propagate taint but controls the flow based on tainted data.
   - If `name_buf` does not match `BOOTFIRM_VER`, it calls `write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite)`. Here, both `name_buf` and `value` are tainted, so the call to `write_value` propagates the taint.
   - If `name_buf` matches `BOOTFIRM_VER`, it calls `increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz)`, where `value` is tainted.

9. **Memory Cleanup**:
   - The function calls `TEE_Free(value)` to free the allocated memory for `value`. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.

10. **Return Value**:
    - The function returns `res`, which may be influenced by the tainted data if either `write_value` or `increase_boot_firmware` modifies the state based on the tainted inputs.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- The `params` array is tainted upon entry into `write_persist_value`.
- The taint propagates to `name_buf` and `value` through assignments and memory operations.
- The function checks the validity of the tainted `name_buf` but does not remove taint.
- Tainted data reaches potential sinks in the calls to `write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware`, which may further process or store the tainted data.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the taint analysis of `write_persist_value` shows that the function effectively propagates tainted data from the `params` array to local variables and potentially to external functions. The taint remains throughout the function, and the final return value may be influenced by the tainted inputs, especially in the context of the called functions.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: increase_boot_firmware</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `increase_boot_firmware` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `new_ver_str` (which is derived from the `params` array in the previous function `write_persist_value`) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `increase_boot_firmware` takes the following parameters:
- `new_ver_str`: A pointer to a character string representing the new firmware version (tainted input).
- `new_ver_sz`: The size of the new firmware version string (of type `uint32_t`).

### Tainted Input
- The `new_ver_str` is tainted as it is passed from the `params[1].memref.buffer` in the `write_persist_value` function, which was previously tainted.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `new_ver_str` is tainted upon entry into `increase_boot_firmware` since it is derived from the tainted `params` in the previous function.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function first checks two conditions:
     - If the system is rollback protected by calling `is_rollback_protected()`.
     - If the new version string is incremental by calling `is_version_incremental(new_ver_str, new_ver_sz)`.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - The taint from `new_ver_str` is propagated into the call to `is_version_incremental(new_ver_str, new_ver_sz)`. If this function uses `new_ver_str`, it will also be working with tainted data.
   - If either of the conditions fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns `TEE_ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`. This does not propagate taint but checks the validity of the tainted data.

4. **Sinks**:
   - If both conditions pass, the function proceeds to call `write_value(BOOTFIRM_VER, strlen(BOOTFIRM_VER) + 1, new_ver_str, new_ver_sz, true)`.
   - Here, `new_ver_str` is passed as an argument to `write_value`, which means the taint is propagated to this function call. The `BOOTFIRM_VER` string is not tainted, but `new_ver_str` is.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the result of the `write_value` call. If `write_value` processes or stores the tainted `new_ver_str`, the taint will persist in the system.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- The `new_ver_str` is tainted upon entry into `increase_boot_firmware`.
- The taint propagates through the function, particularly into the call to `is_version_incremental`, which may also process tainted data.
- If the conditions are met, the taint reaches the `write_value` function, which is a potential sink for the tainted data.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the taint analysis of `increase_boot_firmware` shows that the function effectively propagates tainted data from the `new_ver_str` parameter. The taint remains throughout the function, and the final return value may be influenced by the tainted input, especially in the context of the call to `write_value`. If `write_value` modifies or stores the tainted data, it represents a significant point of concern for data integrity and security.</pre>

<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: is_rollback_protected</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `is_rollback_protected` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input (in this case, the context of the taint from the previous function) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `is_rollback_protected` does not take any parameters. Instead, it checks whether rollback protection is enabled by reading a value associated with `ROLLBACK_PROT`.

### Tainted Input
- The tainted input in this context is indirectly related to the previous function&#x27;s tainted data (`new_ver_str` from `increase_boot_firmware`). However, since `is_rollback_protected` does not directly use any parameters, we will analyze how it interacts with the system state and whether it affects the taint flow.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - The function does not receive any tainted parameters directly. However, it is called in the context of a function (`increase_boot_firmware`) that processes tainted data. Therefore, the function&#x27;s behavior may be influenced by the tainted context.

2. **Reading Rollback Protection Value**:
   - The function calls `read_value(ROLLBACK_PROT, strlen(ROLLBACK_PROT) + 1, value, value_sz, &amp;count)`.
   - The `ROLLBACK_PROT` string is a constant and not tainted. The function attempts to read a value associated with this key into the `value` buffer.
   - The result of this operation is stored in `res`. If `res` is `TEE_SUCCESS`, it indicates that rollback protection is enabled.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - Since `is_rollback_protected` does not directly use any tainted data (like `new_ver_str`), there is no new taint propagation within this function.
   - The function&#x27;s logic is based on the result of `read_value`, which may or may not depend on previously tainted data, but this is not directly observable in the function itself.

4. **Return Value**:
   - If `read_value` succeeds, the function logs a message indicating that rollback protection is enabled and returns `true`. If it fails, it returns `false`.
   - The return value does not propagate any taint; it simply indicates the state of rollback protection.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- The `is_rollback_protected` function does not directly handle any tainted input.
- There is no new taint propagation within this function since it does not use any parameters or variables that are tainted.
- The function interacts with the system state by reading a value associated with `ROLLBACK_PROT`, but this does not involve tainted data.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the taint analysis of `is_rollback_protected` shows that this function does not propagate tainted data. It operates independently of the tainted context established by previous functions. The function&#x27;s purpose is to check the state of rollback protection without introducing or modifying any taint. Therefore, it does not represent a sink for tainted data, and its return value is purely a boolean indicating the status of rollback protection.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: read_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `read_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input (specifically, the `name` parameter, which is derived from the previous function) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `read_value` takes the following parameters:
- `name`: A pointer to a character string representing the name of the object to read (tainted input).
- `name_sz`: The size of the name string (of type `uint32_t`).
- `value`: A pointer to a buffer where the read value will be stored (not tainted initially).
- `value_sz`: The size of the buffer for the value (of type `uint32_t`).
- `count`: A pointer to a variable that will hold the number of bytes read (not tainted initially).

### Tainted Input
- The `name` parameter is tainted as it is derived from the `ROLLBACK_PROT` string in the context of the previous function calls. The taint originates from the context of the `increase_boot_firmware` function, which was influenced by the tainted `new_ver_str`.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `name` parameter is tainted upon entry into `read_value`. The `value` buffer is not tainted initially, but it will be populated with data read from the persistent storage.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function first calls `get_named_object_name(name, name_sz, name_full, &amp;name_full_sz)`.
   - The `name` parameter is passed directly to this function, propagating the taint. If `get_named_object_name` uses `name`, it will also be working with tainted data.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - If `get_named_object_name` returns an error, the function returns that error code, and no further taint propagation occurs.
   - If successful, the function proceeds to call `TEE_OpenPersistentObject(storageid, name_full, name_full_sz, flags, &amp;h)`. The `name_full` variable is populated by `get_named_object_name`, and if it contains any tainted data, it will also be tainted. However, since `name_full` is derived from `name`, it is also tainted.

4. **Reading Object Data**:
   - The function then calls `TEE_ReadObjectData(h, value, value_sz, count)`. This function attempts to read data from the persistent object identified by the handle `h` into the `value` buffer.
   - If `TEE_ReadObjectData` succeeds, the `value` buffer will now contain data that may be tainted, depending on the contents of the persistent object. If the persistent object was created or modified using tainted data, the data read into `value` will also be tainted.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - If `TEE_ReadObjectData` fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns the error code. This does not propagate taint but indicates a failure in reading the data.

6. **Closing the Object**:
   - The function calls `TEE_CloseObject(h)` to close the persistent object handle. This does not affect taint propagation.

7. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the result of the read operation (`res`). If the read was successful, the `value` buffer may now contain tainted data, depending on the state of the persistent object.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- The `name` parameter is tainted upon entry into `read_value`.
- The taint propagates through the function, particularly into the call to `get_named_object_name`, which may also process tainted data.
- If the read operation is successful, the `value` buffer will contain data that may be tainted, depending on the contents of the persistent object.
- The function does not introduce new taint but may propagate existing taint into the `value` buffer.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the taint analysis of `read_value` shows that the function effectively propagates tainted data from the `name` parameter. The taint remains throughout the function, and if the read operation is successful, the `value` buffer may contain tainted data. This represents a potential sink for tainted data, as the contents of `value` could be used in subsequent operations, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.</pre>

<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: get_named_object_name</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `get_named_object_name` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input (specifically, the `name_orig` parameter) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `get_named_object_name` takes the following parameters:
- `name_orig`: A pointer to a character string representing the original name of the object (tainted input).
- `name_orig_size`: The size of the original name string (of type `uint32_t`).
- `name`: A pointer to a buffer where the concatenated name will be stored (not tainted initially).
- `name_size`: A pointer to a variable that will hold the size of the concatenated name (not tainted initially).

### Tainted Input
- The `name_orig` parameter is tainted as it is derived from the previous function&#x27;s context, specifically from the `ROLLBACK_PROT` string or any other tainted data that may have been passed through the call chain.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `name_orig` parameter is tainted upon entry into `get_named_object_name`. The `name` buffer is not tainted initially, but it will be populated with data derived from `name_orig`.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function first checks if the combined size of `name_orig` and the prefix (`named_value_prefix`) exceeds the maximum allowed length (`TEE_OBJECT_ID_MAX_LEN`). If it does, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`, and no further taint propagation occurs.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - If the size check passes, the function uses `TEE_MemMove(name, named_value_prefix, pref_len)` to copy the prefix into the `name` buffer. This operation does not introduce any taint since `named_value_prefix` is a constant and not derived from tainted data.
   - The function then concatenates the provided object name by calling `TEE_MemMove(name + pref_len, name_orig, name_orig_size)`. Here, the tainted `name_orig` is copied into the `name` buffer, starting at the position after the prefix. This means that the `name` buffer now contains tainted data.

4. **Setting the Name Size**:
   - The function sets `*name_size` to the total size of the concatenated name (`name_orig_size + pref_len`). This operation does not affect taint propagation.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `TEE_SUCCESS`, indicating that the operation was successful. The `name` buffer now contains a concatenated string that includes tainted data.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- The `name_orig` parameter is tainted upon entry into `get_named_object_name`.
- The taint propagates through the function, particularly into the `name` buffer when `name_orig` is copied.
- The `name` buffer now contains tainted data after the function completes, which may be used in subsequent operations.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the taint analysis of `get_named_object_name` shows that the function effectively propagates tainted data from the `name_orig` parameter into the `name` buffer. The taint remains throughout the function, and the final state of the `name` buffer contains tainted data that may be used in later operations, such as in the `read_value` function. This represents a potential sink for tainted data, as any subsequent use of the `name` buffer could lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.</pre>

<details>
<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_MemMove</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_MemMove` function in the context of taint data flow, we will consider how it interacts with the parameters that may be affected by tainted data. Since the implementation of `TEE_MemMove` is not provided, we will focus on its expected behavior based on typical memory copy operations and how it relates to the taint analysis results from the previous functions.

### Function Overview
The `TEE_MemMove` function is typically used to copy a block of memory from one location to another. It is important to note that this function can handle overlapping memory regions, which is a key aspect of its behavior.

### Tainted Data Flow Analysis

1. **Parameters Affected by Tainted Data**:
   - In the context of the previous functions, we have identified that the following parameters may be affected by tainted data:
     - `arg0`: This could represent the destination buffer where data is being copied to.
     - `arg1`: This could represent the source buffer from which data is being copied.
     - `arg2`: This could represent the size of the data being copied.

2. **Tracking Tainted Data**:
   - **Source Buffer (`arg1`)**:
     - In the previous analysis, we noted that `name_orig` (tainted) is copied into the `name` buffer using `TEE_MemMove(name + pref_len, name_orig, name_orig_size)`. Here, `name_orig` is the source buffer (`arg1`), which is tainted.
     - If `name_orig` contains tainted data, then any data copied from it into the destination buffer will also be tainted.

   - **Destination Buffer (`arg0`)**:
     - The destination buffer in the first call to `TEE_MemMove` is `name`, which is initially empty but will contain the prefix followed by the tainted data after the second call.
     - After the second call to `TEE_MemMove`, the `name` buffer will contain a concatenated string that includes both the prefix and the tainted data from `name_orig`.

   - **Size of Data (`arg2`)**:
     - The size parameter in both calls to `TEE_MemMove` is derived from the lengths of the respective buffers being copied. In the first call, it is `pref_len`, and in the second call, it is `name_orig_size`.
     - The size parameter itself is not tainted, but it determines how much data is copied from the source to the destination.

3. **Taint Propagation**:
   - When `TEE_MemMove` is called with tainted data as the source buffer, the destination buffer will also become tainted after the operation.
   - In the context of the `get_named_object_name` function, after the execution of both `TEE_MemMove` calls, the `name` buffer will contain tainted data, which can be used in subsequent operations (e.g., in `read_value`).

4. **Potential Sinks**:
   - The `name` buffer, now containing tainted data, will be passed to the `read_value` function. This represents a potential sink for tainted data, as any operations performed on this buffer could lead to security vulnerabilities if the tainted data is not properly validated or sanitized.

### Summary of Taint Flow
- The `TEE_MemMove` function is critical in propagating tainted data from the source buffer (`name_orig`) to the destination buffer (`name`).
- The taint flows through the memory copy operations, ensuring that any tainted data in the source buffer affects the destination buffer.
- The final state of the `name` buffer contains tainted data, which may be used in subsequent operations, particularly in the `read_value` function.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the analysis of `TEE_MemMove` highlights its role in propagating tainted data through memory operations. The function&#x27;s behavior ensures that any tainted data in the source buffer will affect the destination buffer, which can lead to potential security risks if the tainted data is not handled appropriately in subsequent operations. The tracking of tainted data through these memory operations is crucial for understanding the overall security implications of the code.</pre>

The control flow is dependent on the value of <code>cmd</code>, which is not tainted directly but can influence the execution path.<br><br>3. **Case Analysis**:<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>read_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - The <code>params</code> array is passed directly to this function, propagating the taint.<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>write_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Again, the <code>params</code> array is passed directly, propagating the taint.<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>delete_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - The <code>params</code> array is passed directly, propagating the taint.<br>   - **Default Case**:<br>     - If <code>cmd</code> does not match any of the cases, an error message is logged, and <code>TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED</code> is returned. No taint propagation occurs here.<br><br>4. **Data Aliases**:<br>   - The <code>params</code> array is a pointer to an array of <code>TEE_Param</code> structures. If any of these structures are modified within the called functions (<code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, <code>delete_persist_value</code>), the taint will propagate through those modifications.<br>   - If any of the functions modify the contents of <code>params</code>, those modifications will also be tainted.<br><br>5. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - The taint from <code>params</code> is propagated to the return values of the functions called within each case. If any of these functions return a result that depends on the tainted <code>params</code>, the result will also be tainted.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>params</code> array is tainted upon entry into <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>.<br>- The taint is propagated to the called functions based on the value of <code>cmd</code>.<br>- The taint remains through the function calls, and any modifications to <code>params</code> within those functions will continue to propagate the taint.<br>- The control flow based on <code>cmd</code> does not introduce new taint but determines which tainted data is processed.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis shows that the <code>params</code> array is the primary source of taint in the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function. The taint propagates through the function calls based on the command executed, and any modifications to the <code>params</code> array within those functions will maintain the taint. The function does not introduce new taint but relies on the tainted input to determine its behavior.

To analyze the <code>write_persist_value</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>params</code> (from the previous function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>write_persist_value</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>pt</code>: A parameter type (of type <code>uint32_t</code>).<br>- <code>params</code>: An array of <code>TEE_Param</code> structures (of size <code>TEE_NUM_PARAMS</code>).<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The <code>params</code> array is tainted as it is passed from the previous function. Specifically, <code>params[0]</code> and <code>params[1]</code> are of interest since they are used in the function.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - The <code>params</code> array is tainted upon entry into <code>write_persist_value</code>. Specifically, <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> and <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> are tainted.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function first checks if <code>pt</code> matches the expected parameter types (<code>exp_pt</code>). If it does not match, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>, and no taint propagation occurs.<br><br>3. **Tainted Data Usage**:<br>   - **Name Buffer**:<br>     - <code>name_buf</code> is assigned from <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code>, which is tainted. Therefore, <code>name_buf</code> is also tainted.<br>     - <code>name_buf_sz</code> is assigned from <code>params[0].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted but is used to determine the size of the tainted data.<br><br>4. **Validation Check**:<br>   - The function calls <code>check_valid_value(name_buf)</code>. If this function returns <code>TEE_SUCCESS</code>, it indicates that the tainted <code>name_buf</code> is valid. If it fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>. This does not propagate taint but checks the validity of the tainted data.<br><br>5. **Overwrite Logic**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with a vendor prefix or the <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code> string. If it does, the <code>overwrite</code> flag is set to <code>false</code>. This logic does not introduce new taint but uses the tainted <code>name_buf</code> to control the flow.<br><br>6. **Value Buffer**:<br>   - <code>value_sz</code> is assigned from <code>params[1].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted.<br>   - <code>value</code> is allocated using <code>TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)</code>. If the allocation fails, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY</code>, and no taint propagation occurs.<br><br>7. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - The function uses <code>TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)</code>. Here, the tainted data from <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> is copied into the <code>value</code> buffer. Thus, <code>value</code> becomes tainted.<br><br>8. **Conditional Logic**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with the vendor prefix and whether <code>CFG_FIOVB_VENDOR_CREATE</code> is enabled. If not, it sets <code>res</code> to <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code> and logs an error message. This does not propagate taint but controls the flow based on tainted data.<br>   - If <code>name_buf</code> does not match <code>BOOTFIRM_VER</code>, it calls <code>write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite)</code>. Here, both <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code> are tainted, so the call to <code>write_value</code> propagates the taint.<br>   - If <code>name_buf</code> matches <code>BOOTFIRM_VER</code>, it calls <code>increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz)</code>, where <code>value</code> is tainted.<br><br>9. **Memory Cleanup**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_Free(value)</code> to free the allocated memory for <code>value</code>. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.<br><br>10. **Return Value**:<br>    - The function returns <code>res</code>, which may be influenced by the tainted data if either <code>write_value</code> or <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> modifies the state based on the tainted inputs.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>params</code> array is tainted upon entry into <code>write_persist_value</code>.<br>- The taint propagates to <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code> through assignments and memory operations.<br>- The function checks the validity of the tainted <code>name_buf</code> but does not remove taint.<br>- Tainted data reaches potential sinks in the calls to <code>write_value</code> and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>, which may further process or store the tainted data.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis of <code>write_persist_value</code> shows that the function effectively propagates tainted data from the <code>params</code> array to local variables and potentially to external functions. The taint remains throughout the function, and the final return value may be influenced by the tainted inputs, especially in the context of the called functions.

To analyze the <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>new_ver_str</code> (which is derived from the <code>params</code> array in the previous function <code>write_persist_value</code>) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>new_ver_str</code>: A pointer to a character string representing the new firmware version (tainted input).<br>- <code>new_ver_sz</code>: The size of the new firmware version string (of type <code>uint32_t</code>).<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The <code>new_ver_str</code> is tainted as it is passed from the <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> in the <code>write_persist_value</code> function, which was previously tainted.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - The <code>new_ver_str</code> is tainted upon entry into <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> since it is derived from the tainted <code>params</code> in the previous function.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function first checks two conditions:<br>     - If the system is rollback protected by calling <code>is_rollback_protected()</code>.<br>     - If the new version string is incremental by calling <code>is_version_incremental(new_ver_str, new_ver_sz)</code>.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - The taint from <code>new_ver_str</code> is propagated into the call to <code>is_version_incremental(new_ver_str, new_ver_sz)</code>. If this function uses <code>new_ver_str</code>, it will also be working with tainted data.<br>   - If either of the conditions fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</code>. This does not propagate taint but checks the validity of the tainted data.<br><br>4. **Sinks**:<br>   - If both conditions pass, the function proceeds to call <code>write_value(BOOTFIRM_VER, strlen(BOOTFIRM_VER) + 1, new_ver_str, new_ver_sz, true)</code>.<br>   - Here, <code>new_ver_str</code> is passed as an argument to <code>write_value</code>, which means the taint is propagated to this function call.

To analyze the <code>is_rollback_protected</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input (in this case, the context of the taint from the previous function) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>is_rollback_protected</code> does not take any parameters. Instead, it checks whether rollback protection is enabled by reading a value associated with <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code>.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The tainted input in this context is indirectly related to the previous function&#x27;s tainted data (<code>new_ver_str</code> from <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>). However, since <code>is_rollback_protected</code> does not directly use any parameters, we will analyze how it interacts with the system state and whether it affects the taint flow.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial State**:<br>   - The function does not receive any tainted parameters directly. However, it is called in the context of a function (<code>increase_boot_firmware</code>) that processes tainted data. Therefore, the function&#x27;s behavior may be influenced by the tainted context.<br><br>2. **Reading Rollback Protection Value**:<br>   - The function calls <code>read_value(ROLLBACK_PROT, strlen(ROLLBACK_PROT) + 1, value, value_sz, &amp;count)</code>.<br>   - The <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code> string is a constant and not tainted. The function attempts to read a value associated with this key into the <code>value</code> buffer.<br>   - The result of this operation is stored in <code>res</code>. If <code>res</code> is <code>TEE_SUCCESS</code>, it indicates that rollback protection is enabled.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - Since <code>is_rollback_protected</code> does not directly use any tainted data (like <code>new_ver_str</code>), there is no new taint propagation within this function.<br>   - The function&#x27;s logic is based on the result of <code>read_value</code>, which may or may not depend on previously tainted data, but this is not directly observable in the function itself.<br><br>4. **Return Value**:<br>   - If <code>read_value</code> succeeds, the function logs a message indicating that rollback protection is enabled and returns <code>true</code>. If it fails, it returns <code>false</code>.<br>   - The return value does not propagate any taint; it simply indicates the state of rollback protection.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>is_rollback_protected</code> function does not directly handle any tainted input.<br>- There is no new taint propagation within this function since it does not use any parameters or variables that are tainted.<br>- The function interacts with the system state by reading a value associated with <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code>, but this does not involve tainted data.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis of <code>is_rollback_protected</code> shows that this function does not propagate tainted data. It operates independently of the tainted context established by previous functions. The function&#x27;s purpose is to check the state of rollback protection without introducing or modifying any taint. Therefore, it does not represent a sink for tainted data, and its return value is purely a boolean indicating the status of rollback protection.

To analyze the <code>read_value</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input (specifically, the <code>name</code> parameter, which is derived from the previous function) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>read_value</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>name</code>: A pointer to a character string representing the name of the object to read (tainted input).<br>- <code>name_sz</code>: The size of the name string (of type <code>uint32_t</code>).<br>- <code>value</code>: A pointer to a buffer where the read value will be stored (not tainted initially).<br>- <code>value_sz</code>: The size of the buffer for the value (of type <code>uint32_t</code>).<br>- <code>count</code>: A pointer to a variable that will hold the number of bytes read (not tainted initially).<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The <code>name</code> parameter is tainted as it is derived from the <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code> string in the context of the previous function calls. The taint originates from the context of the <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> function, which was influenced by the tainted <code>new_ver_str</code>.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - The <code>name</code> parameter is tainted upon entry into <code>read_value</code>. The <code>value</code> buffer is not tainted initially, but it will be populated with data read from the persistent storage.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function first calls <code>get_named_object_name(name, name_sz, name_full, &amp;name_full_sz)</code>.<br>   - The <code>name</code> parameter is passed directly to this function, propagating the taint. If <code>get_named_object_name</code> uses <code>name</code>, it will also be working with tainted data.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - If <code>get_named_object_name</code> returns an error, the function returns that error code, and no further taint propagation occurs.<br>   - If successful, the function proceeds to call <code>TEE_OpenPersistentObject(storageid, name_full, name_full_sz, flags, &amp;h)</code>. The <code>name_full</code> variable is populated by <code>get_named_object_name</code>, and if it contains any tainted data, it will also be tainted. However, since <code>name_full</code> is derived from <code>name</code>, it is also tainted.<br><br>4. **Reading Object Data**:<br>   - The function then calls <code>TEE_ReadObjectData(h, value, value_sz, count)</code>. This function attempts to read data from the persistent object identified by the handle <code>h</code> into the <code>value</code> buffer.<br>   - If <code>TEE_ReadObjectData</code> succeeds, the <code>value</code> buffer will now contain data that may be tainted, depending on the contents of the persistent object. If the persistent object was created or modified using tainted data, the data read into <code>value</code> will also be tainted.<br><br>5. **Error Handling**:<br>   - If <code>TEE_ReadObjectData</code> fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns the error code. This does not propagate taint but indicates a failure in reading the data.<br><br>6. **Closing the Object**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_CloseObject(h)</code> to close the persistent object handle. This does not affect taint propagation.<br><br>7. **Return Value**:<br>   - The function returns the result of the read operation (<code>res</code>). If the read was successful, the <code>value</code> buffer may now contain tainted data, depending on the state of the persistent object.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>name</code> parameter is tainted upon entry into <code>read_value</code>.<br>- The taint propagates through the function, particularly into the call to <code>get_named_object_name</code>, which may also process tainted data.<br>- If the read operation is successful, the <code>value</code> buffer will contain data that may be tainted, depending on the contents of the persistent object.<br>- The function does not introduce new taint but may propagate existing taint into the <code>value</code> buffer.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis of <code>read_value</code> shows that the function effectively propagates tainted data from the <code>name</code> parameter. The taint remains throughout the function, and if the read operation is successful, the <code>value</code> buffer may contain tainted data. This represents a potential sink for tainted data, as the contents of <code>value</code> could be used in subsequent operations, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

To analyze the <code>get_named_object_name</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input (specifically, the <code>name_orig</code> parameter) flows through this function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>get_named_object_name</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>name_orig</code>: A pointer to a character string representing the original name of the object (tainted input).<br>- <code>name_orig_size</code>: The size of the original name string (of type <code>uint32_t</code>).<br>- <code>name</code>: A pointer to a buffer where the concatenated name will be stored (not tainted initially).<br>- <code>name_size</code>: A pointer to a variable that will hold the size of the concatenated name (not tainted initially).<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The <code>name_orig</code> parameter is tainted as it is derived from the previous function&#x27;s context, specifically from the <code>ROLLBACK_PROT</code> string or any other tainted data that may have been passed through the call chain.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - The <code>name_orig</code> parameter is tainted upon entry into <code>get_named_object_name</code>. The <code>name</code> buffer is not tainted initially, but it will be populated with data derived from <code>name_orig</code>.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function first checks if the combined size of <code>name_orig</code> and the prefix (<code>named_value_prefix</code>) exceeds the maximum allowed length (<code>TEE_OBJECT_ID_MAX_LEN</code>). If it does, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>, and no further taint propagation occurs.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - If the size check passes, the function uses <code>TEE_MemMove(name, named_value_prefix, pref_len)</code> to copy the prefix into the <code>name</code> buffer. This operation does not introduce any taint since <code>named_value_prefix</code> is a constant and not derived from tainted data.<br>   - The function then concatenates the provided object name by calling <code>TEE_MemMove(name + pref_len, name_orig, name_orig_size)</code>. Here, the tainted <code>name_orig</code> is copied into the <code>name</code> buffer, starting at the position after the prefix. This means that the <code>name</code> buffer now contains tainted data.<br><br>4. **Setting the Name Size**:<br>   - The function sets <code>*name_size</code> to the total size of the concatenated name (<code>name_orig_size + pref_len</code>). This operation does not affect taint propagation.<br><br>5. **Return Value**:<br>   - The function returns <code>TEE_SUCCESS</code>, indicating that the operation was successful. The <code>name</code> buffer now contains a concatenated string that includes tainted data.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>name_orig</code> parameter is tainted upon entry into <code>get_named_object_name</code>.<br>- The taint propagates through the function, particularly into the <code>name</code> buffer when <code>name_orig</code> is copied.<br>- The <code>name</code> buffer now contains tainted data after the function completes, which may be used in subsequent operations.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the taint analysis of <code>get_named_object_name</code> shows that the function effectively propagates tainted data from the <code>name_orig</code> parameter into the <code>name</code> buffer. The taint remains throughout the function, and the final state of the <code>name</code> buffer contains tainted data that may be used in later operations, such as in the <code>read_value</code> function. This represents a potential sink for tainted data, as any subsequent use of the <code>name</code> buffer could lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

To analyze the <code>TEE_MemMove</code> function in the context of taint data flow, we will consider how it interacts with the parameters that may be affected by tainted data. Since the implementation of <code>TEE_MemMove</code> is not provided, we will focus on its expected behavior based on typical memory copy operations and how it relates to the taint analysis results from the previous functions.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The <code>TEE_MemMove</code> function is typically used to copy a block of memory from one location to another. It is important to note that this function can handle overlapping memory regions, which is a key aspect of its behavior.<br><br>### Tainted Data Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Parameters Affected by Tainted Data**:<br>   - In the context of the previous functions, we have identified that the following parameters may be affected by tainted data:<br>     - <code>arg0</code>: This could represent the destination buffer where data is being copied to.<br>     - <code>arg1</code>: This could represent the source buffer from which data is being copied.<br>     - <code>arg2</code>: This could represent the size of the data being copied.<br><br>2. **Tracking Tainted Data**:<br>   - **Source Buffer (<code>arg1</code>)**:<br>     - In the previous analysis, we noted that <code>name_orig</code> (tainted) is copied into the <code>name</code> buffer using <code>TEE_MemMove(name + pref_len, name_orig, name_orig_size)</code>. Here, <code>name_orig</code> is the source buffer (<code>arg1</code>), which is tainted.<br>     - If <code>name_orig</code> contains tainted data, then any data copied from it into the destination buffer will also be tainted.<br><br>   - **Destination Buffer (<code>arg0</code>)**:<br>     - The destination buffer in the first call to <code>TEE_MemMove</code> is <code>name</code>, which is initially empty but will contain the prefix followed by the tainted data after the second call.<br>     - After the second call to <code>TEE_MemMove</code>, the <code>name</code> buffer will contain a concatenated string that includes both the prefix and the tainted data from <code>name_orig</code>.<br><br>   - **Size of Data (<code>arg2</code>)**:<br>     - The size parameter in both calls to <code>TEE_MemMove</code> is derived from the lengths of the respective buffers being copied. In the first call, it is <code>pref_len</code>, and in the second call, it is <code>name_orig_size</code>.<br>     - The size parameter itself is not tainted, but it determines how much data is copied from the source to the destination.<br><br>3. **Taint Propagation**:<br>   - When <code>TEE_MemMove</code> is called with tainted data as the source buffer, the destination buffer will also become tainted after the operation.<br>   - In the context of the <code>get_named_object_name</code> function, after the execution of both <code>TEE_MemMove</code> calls, the <code>name</code> buffer will contain tainted data, which can be used in subsequent operations (e.g., in <code>read_value</code>).<br><br>4. **Potential Sinks**:<br>   - The <code>name</code> buffer, now containing tainted data, will be passed to the <code>read_value</code> function. This represents a potential sink for tainted data, as any operations performed on this buffer could lead to security vulnerabilities if the tainted data is not properly validated or sanitized.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Flow<br>- The <code>TEE_MemMove</code> function is critical in propagating tainted data from the source buffer (<code>name_orig</code>) to the destination buffer (<code>name</code>).<br>- The taint flows through the memory copy operations, ensuring that any tainted data in the source buffer affects the destination buffer.<br>- The final state of the <code>name</code> buffer contains tainted data, which may be used in subsequent operations, particularly in the <code>read_value</code> function.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>In conclusion, the analysis of <code>TEE_MemMove</code> highlights its role in propagating tainted data through memory operations. The function&#x27;s behavior ensures that any tainted data in the source buffer will affect the destination buffer, which can lead to potential security risks if the tainted data is not handled appropriately in subsequent operations. The tracking of tainted data through these memory operations is crucial for understanding the overall security implications of the code.

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;`, identify data aliases, note operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flows.

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes the following parameters:
- `void *sess`: Unused session parameter.
- `uint32_t cmd`: Command identifier.
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters that can be tainted.

### Tainted Parameters
The tainted parameters are:
- `params`: This is an array of `TEE_Param` structures, which can contain user-provided data that may be tainted.

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - The `params` array is tainted upon entry into the function. This means that any data within `params` is potentially untrusted.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of `cmd`. The control flow is dependent on the value of `cmd`, which is not tainted but determines which function will be called next.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `read_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - The `params` array is passed directly to this function, propagating the taint.
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `write_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Again, the `params` array is passed directly, propagating the taint.
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `delete_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - The `params` array is passed directly, propagating the taint.
   - **Default Case**:
     - Logs an error message if the command is not supported. This does not propagate taint but indicates that the function does not handle unrecognized commands.

4. **Data Aliases**:
   - The `params` parameter is an array of `TEE_Param`, which may contain pointers or references to other data structures. If any of the `TEE_Param` structures contain pointers to user data, those pointers are also tainted.
   - If any of the functions (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`) manipulate the contents of `params`, they may further propagate taint.

5. **Operations Propagating Taint**:
   - The direct passing of `params` to the three command functions (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`) propagates the taint from the `params` array to these functions.
   - If any of these functions perform operations that modify the contents of `params` or use its data in a way that affects the system state, the taint will continue to propagate.

6. **Implicit Flow**:
   - The control flow based on the `cmd` value is an implicit flow. If the command is valid, the taint from `params` is used in the respective function calls. If the command is invalid, the function does not proceed to use the tainted data, but it does not sanitize or validate it either.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The `params` array is tainted upon entry.
- The taint is propagated to the functions `read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, and `delete_persist_value` through direct parameter passing.
- The control flow based on `cmd` determines which function is called, but does not affect the taint status of `params`.
- Any modifications to `params` within the called functions will continue to propagate the taint.

### Conclusion
The `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function does not perform any sanitization or validation of the `params` input, which is a potential security risk. It is crucial to ensure that the called functions handle the tainted data appropriately to prevent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or unauthorized access to sensitive data.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: write_persist_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `write_persist_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (from the previous function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`) flows through this function, identify any new taint propagation, and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `write_persist_value` takes the following parameters:
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters, which is tainted from the previous function.

### Tainted Input
The tainted input is the `params` array, specifically:
- `params[0].memref.buffer`: This is expected to contain a name (key) for the persistent value.
- `params[1].memref.buffer`: This is expected to contain the value to be written.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The `params` array is tainted upon entry into the function. The contents of `params[0].memref.buffer` and `params[1].memref.buffer` are potentially untrusted.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function first checks if the parameter type `pt` matches the expected type (`exp_pt`). If it does not match, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`, and no further processing occurs. This check does not affect the taint status.

3. **Tainted Data Usage**:
   - `name_buf` is assigned from `params[0].memref.buffer`, which is tainted. Therefore, `name_buf` is also tainted.
   - `name_buf_sz` is assigned the size of `params[0].memref.size`, which is not tainted but is derived from the tainted input.

4. **Validation Check**:
   - The function calls `check_valid_value(name_buf)`, passing the tainted `name_buf`. If this function returns an error, it logs an error message and returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`. This is a potential sink for tainted data, as it could lead to logging sensitive information if `name_buf` contains untrusted data.

5. **Overwrite Logic**:
   - The function checks if `name_buf` starts with a vendor prefix or a rollback protection string. If it does, the `overwrite` flag is set to `false`. This logic does not affect taint propagation but is a control flow decision based on tainted data.

6. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `value_sz` is assigned from `params[1].memref.size`, which is not tainted but derived from tainted input.
   - The function allocates memory for `value` using `TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)`. If the allocation fails, it returns `TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`. The allocation itself does not propagate taint but is important for managing memory.

7. **Tainted Data Movement**:
   - The function uses `TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)`, which copies the contents of the tainted `params[1].memref.buffer` into the newly allocated `value`. This operation propagates the taint from `params[1]` to `value`.

8. **Conditional Logic**:
   - The function checks if `name_buf` matches certain conditions (vendor prefix and boot firmware version). Depending on these checks, it either calls `write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite)` or `increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz)`.
   - Both `write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware` are potential sinks for tainted data, as they will operate on the tainted `name_buf` and `value`.

9. **Memory Deallocation**:
   - The function calls `TEE_Free(value)` to free the allocated memory. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The `params` array is tainted upon entry.
- The taint propagates to `name_buf` and `value` through direct assignments and memory operations.
- The function calls `check_valid_value(name_buf)`, `write_value`, and `increase_boot_firmware`, which are potential sinks for tainted data.
- If any of these functions do not properly handle the tainted data, it could lead to security vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion
The `write_persist_value` function does not adequately sanitize or validate the tainted data from `params`. It is crucial to ensure that the called functions (`check_valid_value`, `write_value`, and `increase_boot_firmware`) handle the tainted data appropriately to prevent vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access or data corruption. Proper validation and sanitization mechanisms should be implemented to mitigate risks associated with tainted data.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TEE_Free</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TEE_Free` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `arg0` (which is the pointer to the memory allocated in the previous function `write_persist_value`) flows through this function. Since the implementation of `TEE_Free` is not provided, we will make reasonable assumptions based on typical memory management functions.

### Tainted Input
The tainted input is `arg0`, which is the pointer to the memory allocated for `value` in the `write_persist_value` function. This memory contains potentially untrusted data that was copied from `params[1].memref.buffer`.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Input**:
   - The `arg0` parameter (the pointer to the memory allocated for `value`) is tainted because it points to memory that contains data copied from a tainted source (`params[1].memref.buffer`).

2. **Function Purpose**:
   - The purpose of `TEE_Free` is to deallocate memory that was previously allocated (in this case, the memory pointed to by `arg0`). The function is expected to release the memory back to the system or memory pool.

3. **Tainted Data Handling**:
   - Since `TEE_Free` is a memory management function, it typically does not process or manipulate the data contained in the memory being freed. Instead, it simply marks the memory as available for future allocations.
   - As a result, `TEE_Free` does not propagate taint further; it merely cleans up resources.

4. **Potential Sinks**:
   - The `TEE_Free` function itself does not represent a sink for tainted data in the sense of data being processed or logged. However, it is important to note that if the memory being freed contained sensitive information, that information could potentially be exposed if not handled properly before freeing.
   - After calling `TEE_Free`, the pointer `arg0` should not be used again unless it is reallocated, as it may lead to undefined behavior (dangling pointer).

### Summary of Taint Propagation
- The tainted input `arg0` is passed to `TEE_Free`.
- `TEE_Free` does not propagate taint; it simply deallocates the memory.
- There are no new taint propagations or sinks within `TEE_Free` since it does not process the data in the memory being freed.

### Conclusion
The `TEE_Free` function does not introduce any new taint propagation or sinks for tainted data. Its role is limited to memory management, and it does not manipulate or expose the contents of the memory being freed. However, it is crucial to ensure that any sensitive data is properly handled before calling `TEE_Free` to prevent potential information leakage. Proper practices should be followed to clear or overwrite sensitive data in memory before deallocation to mitigate risks associated with memory management.</pre>

If the command is invalid, the function does not proceed to use the tainted data, but it does not sanitize or validate it either.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Propagation<br>- The <code>params</code> array is tainted upon entry.<br>- The taint is propagated to the functions <code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, and <code>delete_persist_value</code> through direct parameter passing.<br>- The control flow based on <code>cmd</code> determines which function is called, but does not affect the taint status of <code>params</code>.<br>- Any modifications to <code>params</code> within the called functions will continue to propagate the taint.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>The <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function does not perform any sanitization or validation of the <code>params</code> input, which is a potential security risk. It is crucial to ensure that the called functions handle the tainted data appropriately to prevent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or unauthorized access to sensitive data.

To analyze the <code>write_persist_value</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>params</code> (from the previous function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>) flows through this function, identify any new taint propagation, and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>write_persist_value</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>uint32_t pt</code>: Parameter type.<br>- <code>TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]</code>: Array of parameters, which is tainted from the previous function.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>The tainted input is the <code>params</code> array, specifically:<br>- <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code>: This is expected to contain a name (key) for the persistent value.<br>- <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code>: This is expected to contain the value to be written.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Input**:<br>   - The <code>params</code> array is tainted upon entry into the function. The contents of <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> and <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> are potentially untrusted.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function first checks if the parameter type <code>pt</code> matches the expected type (<code>exp_pt</code>). If it does not match, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>, and no further processing occurs. This check does not affect the taint status.<br><br>3. **Tainted Data Usage**:<br>   - <code>name_buf</code> is assigned from <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code>, which is tainted. Therefore, <code>name_buf</code> is also tainted.<br>   - <code>name_buf_sz</code> is assigned the size of <code>params[0].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted but is derived from the tainted input.<br><br>4. **Validation Check**:<br>   - The function calls <code>check_valid_value(name_buf)</code>, passing the tainted <code>name_buf</code>. If this function returns an error, it logs an error message and returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>. This is a potential sink for tainted data, as it could lead to logging sensitive information if <code>name_buf</code> contains untrusted data.<br><br>5. **Overwrite Logic**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with a vendor prefix or a rollback protection string. If it does, the <code>overwrite</code> flag is set to <code>false</code>. This logic does not affect taint propagation but is a control flow decision based on tainted data.<br><br>6. **Memory Allocation**:<br>   - <code>value_sz</code> is assigned from <code>params[1].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted but derived from tainted input.<br>   - The function allocates memory for <code>value</code> using <code>TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)</code>. If the allocation fails, it returns <code>TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY</code>. The allocation itself does not propagate taint but is important for managing memory.<br><br>7. **Tainted Data Movement**:<br>   - The function uses <code>TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)</code>, which copies the contents of the tainted <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> into the newly allocated <code>value</code>. This operation propagates the taint from <code>params[1]</code> to <code>value</code>.<br><br>8. **Conditional Logic**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> matches certain conditions (vendor prefix and boot firmware version). Depending on these checks, it either calls <code>write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite)</code> or <code>increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz)</code>.<br>   - Both <code>write_value</code> and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> are potential sinks for tainted data, as they will operate on the tainted <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code>.<br><br>9. **Memory Deallocation**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_Free(value)</code> to free the allocated memory. This does not affect taint propagation but is important for resource management.<br><br>### Summary of Taint Propagation<br>- The <code>params</code> array is tainted upon entry.<br>- The taint propagates to <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code> through direct assignments and memory operations.<br>- The function calls <code>check_valid_value(name_buf)</code>, <code>write_value</code>, and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>, which are potential sinks for tainted data.<br>- If any of these functions do not properly handle the tainted data, it could lead to security vulnerabilities.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>The <code>write_persist_value</code> function does not adequately sanitize or validate the tainted data from <code>params</code>. It is crucial to ensure that the called functions (<code>check_valid_value</code>, <code>write_value</code>, and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>) handle the tainted data appropriately to prevent vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access or data corruption. Proper validation and sanitization mechanisms should be implemented to mitigate risks associated with tainted data.

To analyze the <code>TEE_Free</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>arg0</code> (which is the pointer to the memory allocated in the previous function <code>write_persist_value</code>) flows through this function. Since the implementation of <code>TEE_Free</code> is not provided, we will make reasonable assumptions based on typical memory management functions.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>The tainted input is <code>arg0</code>, which is the pointer to the memory allocated for <code>value</code> in the <code>write_persist_value</code> function. This memory contains potentially untrusted data that was copied from <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code>.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Input**:<br>   - The <code>arg0</code> parameter (the pointer to the memory allocated for <code>value</code>) is tainted because it points to memory that contains data copied from a tainted source (<code>params[1].memref.buffer</code>).<br><br>2. **Function Purpose**:<br>   - The purpose of <code>TEE_Free</code> is to deallocate memory that was previously allocated (in this case, the memory pointed to by <code>arg0</code>). The function is expected to release the memory back to the system or memory pool.<br><br>3. **Tainted Data Handling**:<br>   - Since <code>TEE_Free</code> is a memory management function, it typically does not process or manipulate the data contained in the memory being freed. Instead, it simply marks the memory as available for future allocations.<br>   - As a result, <code>TEE_Free</code> does not propagate taint further; it merely cleans up resources.<br><br>4. **Potential Sinks**:<br>   - The <code>TEE_Free</code> function itself does not represent a sink for tainted data in the sense of data being processed or logged. However, it is important to note that if the memory being freed contained sensitive information, that information could potentially be exposed if not handled properly before freeing.<br>   - After calling <code>TEE_Free</code>, the pointer <code>arg0</code> should not be used again unless it is reallocated, as it may lead to undefined behavior (dangling pointer).<br><br>### Summary of Taint Propagation<br>- The tainted input <code>arg0</code> is passed to <code>TEE_Free</code>.<br>- <code>TEE_Free</code> does not propagate taint; it simply deallocates the memory.<br>- There are no new taint propagations or sinks within <code>TEE_Free</code> since it does not process the data in the memory being freed.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>The <code>TEE_Free</code> function does not introduce any new taint propagation or sinks for tainted data. Its role is limited to memory management, and it does not manipulate or expose the contents of the memory being freed. However, it is crucial to ensure that any sensitive data is properly handled before calling <code>TEE_Free</code> to prevent potential information leakage. Proper practices should be followed to clear or overwrite sensitive data in memory before deallocation to mitigate risks associated with memory management.

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters `&lt;param_types&gt;` and `&lt;params&gt;` as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flow.

### Function Overview
The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` takes the following parameters:
- `void *sess`: Unused session parameter.
- `uint32_t cmd`: Command identifier.
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters that can be tainted.

### Tainted Parameters
- The parameters `pt` and `params` are considered tainted. The `params` array is particularly important as it can contain sensitive data that may be manipulated or used in subsequent operations.

### Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - `params` is tainted as it is passed directly into the function.
   - `pt` is also tainted, but its impact depends on how it is used in the function.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of `cmd`. The value of `cmd` is not tainted, but it controls which function is called next.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `read_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Tainted data: `params` is passed directly, so any data within `params` remains tainted.
     - `pt` is also passed, but its effect on taint propagation depends on the implementation of `read_persist_value`.

   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `write_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Similar to the previous case, `params` remains tainted as it is passed directly.
     - `pt` is also passed, and its effect on taint propagation depends on the implementation of `write_persist_value`.

   - **Case `TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE`**:
     - Calls `delete_persist_value(pt, params)`.
     - Again, `params` remains tainted as it is passed directly.
     - The effect of `pt` on taint propagation depends on the implementation of `delete_persist_value`.

   - **Default Case**:
     - If `cmd` does not match any of the cases, an error message is logged, and `TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` is returned. No tainted data is propagated in this case.

### Data Aliases
- The `params` array is a pointer to `TEE_Param` structures. If any of these structures are modified within the called functions (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`), the taint will propagate to those modifications.
- If any of the functions modify the contents of `params`, the taint will persist in those modifications.

### Operations Propagating Taint
- The direct passing of `params` to the three command functions (`read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, `delete_persist_value`) propagates the taint.
- If any of these functions perform assignments or modifications to the `params` array or its elements, the taint will propagate further.

### Implicit Flow
- The control flow through the `switch` statement is dependent on the value of `cmd`. If `cmd` is influenced by external tainted data, it could lead to different paths being taken, which may affect the overall security of the function.

### Summary
- The tainted parameters `params` and `pt` are passed to three different functions based on the value of `cmd`.
- The `params` array remains tainted throughout the function and can propagate taint to the called functions.
- The control flow based on `cmd` can lead to different handling of tainted data, depending on the implementation of the called functions.
- Care should be taken in the implementations of `read_persist_value`, `write_persist_value`, and `delete_persist_value` to ensure that tainted data is handled securely.</pre>

<summary><strong>Èñ¢Êï∞: write_persist_value</strong></summary>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To analyze the `write_persist_value` function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input `params` (specifically `params[0]` and `params[1]`) flows through the function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.

### Function Overview
The function `write_persist_value` takes the following parameters:
- `uint32_t pt`: Parameter type.
- `TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]`: Array of parameters, where `params[0]` is expected to be a memory reference for the name and `params[1]` is expected to be a memory reference for the value.

### Tainted Input
- The `params` array is tainted as it is passed from the previous function (`TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`).
- Specifically, `params[0].memref.buffer` (the name) and `params[1].memref.buffer` (the value) are the key areas of interest for taint propagation.

### Taint Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - `params[0]` and `params[1]` are tainted as they are passed into the function.
   - The function checks the parameter type `pt` against an expected value (`exp_pt`). If `pt` does not match, the function returns early with `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`, and no taint propagation occurs.

2. **Tainted Data Usage**:
   - `name_buf` is assigned from `params[0].memref.buffer`, which is tainted. Therefore, `name_buf` is also tainted.
   - `name_buf_sz` is assigned from `params[0].memref.size`, which is not tainted but is used to determine the size of the tainted buffer.

3. **Validation Check**:
   - The function calls `check_valid_value(name_buf)`. If this function uses `name_buf` in a way that could lead to a security issue (e.g., logging or processing), the taint is propagated. If it returns `TEE_SUCCESS`, the function continues; otherwise, it logs an error and returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`.

4. **Overwrite Logic**:
   - The function checks if `name_buf` starts with a vendor prefix or a rollback protection string. If it does, the `overwrite` flag is set to `false`. This logic does not affect taint propagation but is important for security checks.

5. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `value_sz` is assigned from `params[1].memref.size`, which is not tainted. However, it is used to allocate memory for `value` using `TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)`. If `value_sz` is derived from tainted data, the allocation could be influenced by tainted input.
   - If the allocation fails, the function returns `TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`, and no taint propagation occurs.

6. **Copying Tainted Data**:
   - The function uses `TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)`. Here, `params[1].memref.buffer` is tainted, and thus `value` becomes tainted as it copies the contents of the tainted buffer into a new location.

7. **Conditional Logic**:
   - The function checks if `name_buf` starts with a vendor prefix and whether vendor creation is enabled. If not, it sets `res` to `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS` and logs an error. This does not propagate taint but is a security check.
   - If `name_buf` does not match the boot firmware version, it calls `write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite)`. Here, both `name_buf` and `value` are tainted, so the taint propagates to this function call.
   - If it matches the boot firmware version, it calls `increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz)`, where `value` is tainted.

8. **Freeing Memory**:
   - The function calls `TEE_Free(value)`, which does not affect taint propagation but is important for memory management.

9. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `res`, which may indicate success or failure based on the operations performed. If any of the operations involved tainted data, the result could be influenced by that taint.

### Sinks
- The potential sinks in this function are:
  - The logging of `name_buf` in the `EMSG` calls, which could expose tainted data if the checks fail.
  - The calls to `write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware`, which may perform operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities if they handle tainted data improperly.

### Summary
- The tainted input `params` flows through the `write_persist_value` function, with `name_buf` and `value` being the primary carriers of taint.
- Taint is propagated through memory allocation and data copying operations.
- The function contains security checks that prevent certain operations based on the content of `name_buf`, but it also has potential sinks where tainted data could be logged or processed.
- Care should be taken in the implementations of `check_valid_value`, `write_value`, and `increase_boot_firmware` to ensure that tainted data is handled securely.</pre>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: 0.5rem;">To continue the taint analysis, we will focus on how tainted data can affect the parameters `arg0`, `arg1`, and `arg2` in the context of the `write_persist_value` function. We will track the flow of tainted data through the function, paying special attention to data aliases and operations that propagate taint.

### Function Overview
The `write_persist_value` function processes two main parameters from the `params` array:
- `params[0]` (alias `arg0`): Expected to be a memory reference containing the name.
- `params[1]` (alias `arg1`): Expected to be a memory reference containing the value.
- `params[2]` (alias `arg2`): Not used in this function, but we will consider its potential impact if it were to be used in future calls.

### Tainted Data Flow Analysis

1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:
   - `params[0]` (alias `arg0`) is tainted as it is passed from the previous function. Specifically, `params[0].memref.buffer` is tainted and assigned to `name_buf`.
   - `params[1]` (alias `arg1`) is also tainted, with `params[1].memref.buffer` being assigned to `value` after memory allocation.

2. **Tainted Data Operations**:
   - **Name Buffer (`arg0`)**:
     - The `name_buf` variable is directly assigned from `params[0].memref.buffer`, making it tainted.
     - The function checks if `name_buf` starts with a vendor prefix or a rollback protection string using `strncmp`. This operation does not modify `name_buf` but uses it in a comparison, which could lead to security issues if the comparison is logged or affects control flow.
     - If `check_valid_value(name_buf)` returns an error, it logs the tainted `name_buf` and returns an error code. This is a potential sink for tainted data.

   - **Value Buffer (`arg1`)**:
     - The `value` variable is assigned from `params[1].memref.buffer` after a successful memory allocation. This means `value` is also tainted.
     - The function uses `TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)` to copy the contents of the tainted buffer into `value`. This operation propagates the taint to `value`.
     - The `value` is then used in the calls to `write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware`, both of which could be sinks for tainted data.

3. **Unused Parameter (`arg2`)**:
   - `params[2]` (alias `arg2`) is not used in the `write_persist_value` function. However, if it were to be used in future modifications of the function, it could potentially be affected by tainted data if the function were to include logic that references `params[2]`.

### Summary of Tainted Data Flow
- **`arg0` (params[0])**:
  - Tainted data flows from `params[0].memref.buffer` to `name_buf`.
  - The taint is propagated through the `check_valid_value` function and the `strncmp` checks.
  - If any of these checks log or process `name_buf`, it could lead to exposure of tainted data.

- **`arg1` (params[1])**:
  - Tainted data flows from `params[1].memref.buffer` to `value`.
  - The taint is propagated through the `TEE_MemMove` operation.
  - The `value` is then used in subsequent function calls (`write_value` and `increase_boot_firmware`), which could be sinks for tainted data.

- **`arg2` (params[2])**:
  - Not used in this function, but if it were to be referenced in future modifications, it could potentially be affected by tainted data if the function logic were to change.

### Conclusion
The `write_persist_value` function effectively propagates tainted data from its input parameters to local variables and potentially to external function calls. The analysis highlights the importance of careful handling of tainted data, especially in logging and external function calls, to prevent security vulnerabilities. Future modifications to the function should consider the implications of using `params[2]` and ensure that all paths maintain data integrity and security.</pre>

To analyze the <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> function for taint data flow, we will track the tainted parameters <code>&lt;param_types&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> as they flow through the function. We will also identify any data aliases, operations that propagate taint, and consider both explicit and implicit data flow.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>void *sess</code>: Unused session parameter.<br>- <code>uint32_t cmd</code>: Command identifier.<br>- <code>uint32_t pt</code>: Parameter type.<br>- <code>TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]</code>: Array of parameters that can be tainted.<br><br>### Tainted Parameters<br>- The parameters <code>pt</code> and <code>params</code> are considered tainted. The <code>params</code> array is particularly important as it can contain sensitive data that may be manipulated or used in subsequent operations.<br><br>### Data Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - <code>params</code> is tainted as it is passed directly into the function.<br>   - <code>pt</code> is also tainted, but its impact depends on how it is used in the function.<br><br>2. **Control Flow**:<br>   - The function uses a <code>switch</code> statement to determine which command to execute based on the value of <code>cmd</code>. The value of <code>cmd</code> is not tainted, but it controls which function is called next.<br><br>3. **Case Analysis**:<br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_READ_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>read_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Tainted data: <code>params</code> is passed directly, so any data within <code>params</code> remains tainted.<br>     - <code>pt</code> is also passed, but its effect on taint propagation depends on the implementation of <code>read_persist_value</code>.<br><br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_WRITE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>write_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Similar to the previous case, <code>params</code> remains tainted as it is passed directly.<br>     - <code>pt</code> is also passed, and its effect on taint propagation depends on the implementation of <code>write_persist_value</code>.<br><br>   - **Case <code>TA_FIOVB_CMD_DELETE_PERSIST_VALUE</code>**:<br>     - Calls <code>delete_persist_value(pt, params)</code>.<br>     - Again, <code>params</code> remains tainted as it is passed directly.<br>     - The effect of <code>pt</code> on taint propagation depends on the implementation of <code>delete_persist_value</code>.<br><br>   - **Default Case**:<br>     - If <code>cmd</code> does not match any of the cases, an error message is logged, and <code>TEE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED</code> is returned. No tainted data is propagated in this case.<br><br>### Data Aliases<br>- The <code>params</code> array is a pointer to <code>TEE_Param</code> structures. If any of these structures are modified within the called functions (<code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, <code>delete_persist_value</code>), the taint will propagate to those modifications.<br>- If any of the functions modify the contents of <code>params</code>, the taint will persist in those modifications.<br><br>### Operations Propagating Taint<br>- The direct passing of <code>params</code> to the three command functions (<code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, <code>delete_persist_value</code>) propagates the taint.<br>- If any of these functions perform assignments or modifications to the <code>params</code> array or its elements, the taint will propagate further.<br><br>### Implicit Flow<br>- The control flow through the <code>switch</code> statement is dependent on the value of <code>cmd</code>. If <code>cmd</code> is influenced by external tainted data, it could lead to different paths being taken, which may affect the overall security of the function.<br><br>### Summary<br>- The tainted parameters <code>params</code> and <code>pt</code> are passed to three different functions based on the value of <code>cmd</code>.<br>- The <code>params</code> array remains tainted throughout the function and can propagate taint to the called functions.<br>- The control flow based on <code>cmd</code> can lead to different handling of tainted data, depending on the implementation of the called functions.<br>- Care should be taken in the implementations of <code>read_persist_value</code>, <code>write_persist_value</code>, and <code>delete_persist_value</code> to ensure that tainted data is handled securely.

To analyze the <code>write_persist_value</code> function for taint data flow, we will track how the tainted input <code>params</code> (specifically <code>params[0]</code> and <code>params[1]</code>) flows through the function. We will identify any new taint propagation and check if tainted data reaches any sinks.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The function <code>write_persist_value</code> takes the following parameters:<br>- <code>uint32_t pt</code>: Parameter type.<br>- <code>TEE_Param params[TEE_NUM_PARAMS]</code>: Array of parameters, where <code>params[0]</code> is expected to be a memory reference for the name and <code>params[1]</code> is expected to be a memory reference for the value.<br><br>### Tainted Input<br>- The <code>params</code> array is tainted as it is passed from the previous function (<code>TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint</code>).<br>- Specifically, <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> (the name) and <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> (the value) are the key areas of interest for taint propagation.<br><br>### Taint Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - <code>params[0]</code> and <code>params[1]</code> are tainted as they are passed into the function.<br>   - The function checks the parameter type <code>pt</code> against an expected value (<code>exp_pt</code>). If <code>pt</code> does not match, the function returns early with <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>, and no taint propagation occurs.<br><br>2. **Tainted Data Usage**:<br>   - <code>name_buf</code> is assigned from <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code>, which is tainted. Therefore, <code>name_buf</code> is also tainted.<br>   - <code>name_buf_sz</code> is assigned from <code>params[0].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted but is used to determine the size of the tainted buffer.<br><br>3. **Validation Check**:<br>   - The function calls <code>check_valid_value(name_buf)</code>. If this function uses <code>name_buf</code> in a way that could lead to a security issue (e.g., logging or processing), the taint is propagated. If it returns <code>TEE_SUCCESS</code>, the function continues; otherwise, it logs an error and returns <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code>.<br><br>4. **Overwrite Logic**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with a vendor prefix or a rollback protection string. If it does, the <code>overwrite</code> flag is set to <code>false</code>. This logic does not affect taint propagation but is important for security checks.<br><br>5. **Memory Allocation**:<br>   - <code>value_sz</code> is assigned from <code>params[1].memref.size</code>, which is not tainted. However, it is used to allocate memory for <code>value</code> using <code>TEE_Malloc(value_sz, 0)</code>. If <code>value_sz</code> is derived from tainted data, the allocation could be influenced by tainted input.<br>   - If the allocation fails, the function returns <code>TEE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY</code>, and no taint propagation occurs.<br><br>6. **Copying Tainted Data**:<br>   - The function uses <code>TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)</code>. Here, <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> is tainted, and thus <code>value</code> becomes tainted as it copies the contents of the tainted buffer into a new location.<br><br>7. **Conditional Logic**:<br>   - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with a vendor prefix and whether vendor creation is enabled. If not, it sets <code>res</code> to <code>TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS</code> and logs an error. This does not propagate taint but is a security check.<br>   - If <code>name_buf</code> does not match the boot firmware version, it calls <code>write_value(name_buf, name_buf_sz, value, value_sz, overwrite)</code>. Here, both <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code> are tainted, so the taint propagates to this function call.<br>   - If it matches the boot firmware version, it calls <code>increase_boot_firmware(value, value_sz)</code>, where <code>value</code> is tainted.<br><br>8. **Freeing Memory**:<br>   - The function calls <code>TEE_Free(value)</code>, which does not affect taint propagation but is important for memory management.<br><br>9. **Return Value**:<br>   - The function returns <code>res</code>, which may indicate success or failure based on the operations performed. If any of the operations involved tainted data, the result could be influenced by that taint.<br><br>### Sinks<br>- The potential sinks in this function are:<br>  - The logging of <code>name_buf</code> in the <code>EMSG</code> calls, which could expose tainted data if the checks fail.<br>  - The calls to <code>write_value</code> and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>, which may perform operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities if they handle tainted data improperly.<br><br>### Summary<br>- The tainted input <code>params</code> flows through the <code>write_persist_value</code> function, with <code>name_buf</code> and <code>value</code> being the primary carriers of taint.<br>- Taint is propagated through memory allocation and data copying operations.<br>- The function contains security checks that prevent certain operations based on the content of <code>name_buf</code>, but it also has potential sinks where tainted data could be logged or processed.<br>- Care should be taken in the implementations of <code>check_valid_value</code>, <code>write_value</code>, and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code> to ensure that tainted data is handled securely.

To continue the taint analysis, we will focus on how tainted data can affect the parameters <code>arg0</code>, <code>arg1</code>, and <code>arg2</code> in the context of the <code>write_persist_value</code> function. We will track the flow of tainted data through the function, paying special attention to data aliases and operations that propagate taint.<br><br>### Function Overview<br>The <code>write_persist_value</code> function processes two main parameters from the <code>params</code> array:<br>- <code>params[0]</code> (alias <code>arg0</code>): Expected to be a memory reference containing the name.<br>- <code>params[1]</code> (alias <code>arg1</code>): Expected to be a memory reference containing the value.<br>- <code>params[2]</code> (alias <code>arg2</code>): Not used in this function, but we will consider its potential impact if it were to be used in future calls.<br><br>### Tainted Data Flow Analysis<br><br>1. **Initial Tainted Parameters**:<br>   - <code>params[0]</code> (alias <code>arg0</code>) is tainted as it is passed from the previous function. Specifically, <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> is tainted and assigned to <code>name_buf</code>.<br>   - <code>params[1]</code> (alias <code>arg1</code>) is also tainted, with <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> being assigned to <code>value</code> after memory allocation.<br><br>2. **Tainted Data Operations**:<br>   - **Name Buffer (<code>arg0</code>)**:<br>     - The <code>name_buf</code> variable is directly assigned from <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code>, making it tainted.<br>     - The function checks if <code>name_buf</code> starts with a vendor prefix or a rollback protection string using <code>strncmp</code>. This operation does not modify <code>name_buf</code> but uses it in a comparison, which could lead to security issues if the comparison is logged or affects control flow.<br>     - If <code>check_valid_value(name_buf)</code> returns an error, it logs the tainted <code>name_buf</code> and returns an error code. This is a potential sink for tainted data.<br><br>   - **Value Buffer (<code>arg1</code>)**:<br>     - The <code>value</code> variable is assigned from <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> after a successful memory allocation. This means <code>value</code> is also tainted.<br>     - The function uses <code>TEE_MemMove(value, params[1].memref.buffer, value_sz)</code> to copy the contents of the tainted buffer into <code>value</code>. This operation propagates the taint to <code>value</code>.<br>     - The <code>value</code> is then used in the calls to <code>write_value</code> and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>, both of which could be sinks for tainted data.<br><br>3. **Unused Parameter (<code>arg2</code>)**:<br>   - <code>params[2]</code> (alias <code>arg2</code>) is not used in the <code>write_persist_value</code> function. However, if it were to be used in future modifications of the function, it could potentially be affected by tainted data if the function were to include logic that references <code>params[2]</code>.<br><br>### Summary of Tainted Data Flow<br>- **<code>arg0</code> (params[0])**:<br>  - Tainted data flows from <code>params[0].memref.buffer</code> to <code>name_buf</code>.<br>  - The taint is propagated through the <code>check_valid_value</code> function and the <code>strncmp</code> checks.<br>  - If any of these checks log or process <code>name_buf</code>, it could lead to exposure of tainted data.<br><br>- **<code>arg1</code> (params[1])**:<br>  - Tainted data flows from <code>params[1].memref.buffer</code> to <code>value</code>.<br>  - The taint is propagated through the <code>TEE_MemMove</code> operation.<br>  - The <code>value</code> is then used in subsequent function calls (<code>write_value</code> and <code>increase_boot_firmware</code>), which could be sinks for tainted data.<br><br>- **<code>arg2</code> (params[2])**:<br>  - Not used in this function, but if it were to be referenced in future modifications, it could potentially be affected by tainted data if the function logic were to change.<br><br>### Conclusion<br>The <code>write_persist_value</code> function effectively propagates tainted data from its input parameters to local variables and potentially to external function calls. The analysis highlights the importance of careful handling of tainted data, especially in logging and external function calls, to prevent security vulnerabilities. Future modifications to the function should consider the implications of using <code>params[2]</code> and ensure that all paths maintain data integrity and security.
