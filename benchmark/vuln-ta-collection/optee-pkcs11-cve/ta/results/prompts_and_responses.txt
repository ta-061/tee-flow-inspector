# External Function: ADD_OVERFLOW
## Prompt:
You are a documentation‑informed screener for potential vulnerability sinks in OP‑TEE Trusted Applications (TAs).

TASK
Given ONLY a function name "ADD_OVERFLOW", return a binary decision:
- true  = sink candidate by semantics derived from the name AND your knowledge of GP TEE v1.3.1 / common C APIs
- false = not a sink candidate at this stage

THREAT CLASSES (consider any that apply)
1) Information leakage: writes attacker‑influenced bytes into REE‑visible or external buffers/channels.
2) Memory corruption: writes into a buffer where the write extent can be attacker‑controlled (len/size/loop bound).
3) Integrity impact: writes attacker‑influenced bytes to persistent/object/IO sinks affecting behavior on reload.

INCLUSION — DOCUMENTED WRITE FAMILIES (no project‑specific whitelists; use API family knowledge)
Return true if you can map the name to ONE of these families AND identify at least the destination/target parameter.
- A) memcpy‑like copy to destination buffer  
  Canonical roles: dest → idx 0; len/size → idx 2 when such param exists.
- B) printf/format‑like buffered output  
  Canonical roles: dest → idx 0; len/size → idx 1 when size is explicit.
- C) fill / random‑to‑buffer (memset/random‑like; writes pattern/generated bytes)  
  Canonical roles: dest → idx 0; len/size → idx 1 or 2 (use the documented position).
- D) persistent/object/IO write (handle, buf, len)  
  Canonical roles: buf → idx 1; len/size → idx 2.

NON‑EMPTY GUARD (avoid zero‑finds without over‑inclusion)
- If the name clearly belongs to A/B/C/D by documentation or widely known C/TEE conventions but ONLY the destination index is canonical for you, still return true with that single dangerous_param.  
- If you cannot confidently assign even the destination/target index, return false.

EXCLUSIONS (always return false at this stage)
- Allocation/Deallocation/Init/Reset/Populate/Key‑setup families (state/handle management; no byte writes).
- Crypto primitives (Cipher/AE/Asymmetric; incl. Init/Update/Final) — internal transforms, not plaintext sinks.
- Debug/trace/log macros (TRACE_*, DMSG/IMSG/EMSG) — exclude to reduce noise.
- Type/descriptor/access‑check helpers (e.g., PARAM_TYPES, Check*).
- Ambiguous verbs (process/handle/update/prepare/compute/convert) lacking a clear, documented write signature.

DANGEROUS PARAMS (emit only canonical, cross‑platform‑stable roles)
- Prefer dest/buf and len/size. Never mark memcpy‑like source (idx 1) as dangerous.
- If a family typically has no explicit length (e.g., some sprintf variants), emit just dest.

THREAT CLASSES (consider any that apply)
1) Information leakage: writes attacker‑influenced bytes into REE‑visible or external buffers/channels.
2) Memory corruption: writes into a buffer where the write extent can be attacker‑controlled (len/size/loop bound).
3) Integrity impact: writes attacker‑influenced bytes to persistent/object/IO sinks affecting behavior on reload.

INCLUSION — DOCUMENTED WRITE FAMILIES (no project‑specific whitelists; use API family knowledge)
Return true if you can map the name to ONE of these families AND identify at least the destination/target parameter.
- A) memcpy‑like copy to destination buffer  
  Canonical roles: dest → idx 0; len/size → idx 2 when such param exists.

  Canonical roles: dest → idx 0; len/size → idx 1 when size is explicit.
- C) fill / random‑to‑buffer (memset/random‑like; writes pattern/generated bytes)  
  Canonical roles: dest → idx 0; len/size → idx 1 or 2 (use the documented position).
- D) persistent/object/IO write (handle, buf, len)  
  Canonical roles: buf → idx 1; len/size → idx 2.

NON‑EMPTY GUARD (avoid zero‑finds without over‑inclusion)
- If the name clearly belongs to A/B/C/D by documentation or widely known C/TEE conventions but ONLY the destination index is canonical for you, still return true with that single dangerous_param.  
- If you cannot confidently assign even the destination/target index, return false.

EXCLUSIONS (always return false at this stage)
- Allocation/Deallocation/Init/Reset/Populate/Key‑setup families (state/handle management; no byte writes).
- Crypto primitives (Cipher/AE/Asymmetric; incl. Init/Update/Final) — internal transforms, not plaintext sinks.

- Type/descriptor/access‑check helpers (e.g., PARAM_TYPES, Check*).
- Ambiguous verbs (process/handle/update/prepare/compute/convert) lacking a clear, documented write signature.

DANGEROUS PARAMS (emit only canonical, cross‑platform‑stable roles)

You are a documentation‑informed screener for potential vulnerability sinks in OP‑TEE Trusted Applications (TAs).

TASK
Given ONLY a function name "mbedtls_ecp_keypair_free", return a binary decision:
- true  = sink candidate by semantics derived from the name AND your knowledge of GP TEE v1.3.1 / common C APIs
- false = not a sink candidate at this stage

THREAT CLASSES (consider any that apply)
1) Information leakage: writes attacker‑influenced bytes into REE‑visible or external buffers/channels.
2) Memory corruption: writes into a buffer where the write extent can be attacker‑controlled (len/size/loop bound).
3) Integrity impact: writes attacker‑influenced bytes to persistent/object/IO sinks affecting behavior on reload.

INCLUSION — DOCUMENTED WRITE FAMILIES (no project‑specific whitelists; use API family knowledge)
Return true if you can map the name to ONE of these families AND identify at least the destination/target parameter.
- A) memcpy‑like copy to destination buffer  
  Canonical roles: dest → idx 0; len/size → idx 2 when such param exists.
- B) printf/format‑like buffered output  
  Canonical roles: dest → idx 0; len/size → idx 1 when size is explicit.
- C) fill / random‑to‑buffer (memset/random‑like; writes pattern/generated bytes)  
  Canonical roles: dest → idx 0; len/size → idx 1 or 2 (use the documented position).
- D) persistent/object/IO write (handle, buf, len)  
  Canonical roles: buf → idx 1; len/size → idx 2.

NON‑EMPTY GUARD (avoid zero‑finds without over‑inclusion)
- If the name clearly belongs to A/B/C/D by documentation or widely known C/TEE conventions but ONLY the destination index is canonical for you, still return true with that single dangerous_param.  
- If you cannot confidently assign even the destination/target index, return false.

EXCLUSIONS (always return false at this stage)
- Allocation/Deallocation/Init/Reset/Populate/Key‑setup families (state/handle management; no byte writes).
- Crypto primitives (Cipher/AE/Asymmetric; incl. Init/Update/Final) — internal transforms, not plaintext sinks.
- Debug/trace/log macros (TRACE_*, DMSG/IMSG/EMSG) — exclude to reduce noise.
- Type/descriptor/access‑check helpers (e.g., PARAM_TYPES, Check*).
- Ambiguous verbs (process/handle/update/prepare/compute/convert) lacking a clear, documented write signature.

DANGEROUS PARAMS (emit only canonical, cross‑platform‑stable roles)
- Prefer dest/buf and len/size. Never mark memcpy‑like source (idx 1) as dangerous.
- If a family typically has no explicit length (e.g., some sprintf variants), emit just dest.

# External Function: mbedtls_mpi_init
## Prompt:
You are a documentation‑informed screener for potential vulnerability sinks in OP‑TEE Trusted Applications (TAs).

TASK
Given ONLY a function name "mbedtls_mpi_init", return a binary decision:
- true  = sink candidate by semantics derived from the name AND your knowledge of GP TEE v1.3.1 / common C APIs
- false = not a sink candidate at this stage

THREAT CLASSES (consider any that apply)
1) Information leakage: writes attacker‑influenced bytes into REE‑visible or external buffers/channels.
2) Memory corruption: writes into a buffer where the write extent can be attacker‑controlled (len/size/loop bound).
3) Integrity impact: writes attacker‑influenced bytes to persistent/object/IO sinks affecting behavior on reload.

INCLUSION — DOCUMENTED WRITE FAMILIES (no project‑specific whitelists; use API family knowledge)
Return true if you can map the name to ONE of these families AND identify at least the destination/target parameter.
- A) memcpy‑like copy to destination buffer  
  Canonical roles: dest → idx 0; len/size → idx 2 when such param exists.
- B) printf/format‑like buffered output  
  Canonical roles: dest → idx 0; len/size → idx 1 when size is explicit.
- C) fill / random‑to‑buffer (memset/random‑like; writes pattern/generated bytes)  
  Canonical roles: dest → idx 0; len/size → idx 1 or 2 (use the documented position).
- D) persistent/object/IO write (handle, buf, len)  
  Canonical roles: buf → idx 1; len/size → idx 2.

NON‑EMPTY GUARD (avoid zero‑finds without over‑inclusion)
- If the name clearly belongs to A/B/C/D by documentation or widely known C/TEE conventions but ONLY the destination index is canonical for you, still return true with that single dangerous_param.  
- If you cannot confidently assign even the destination/target index, return false.

EXCLUSIONS (always return false at this stage)
- Allocation/Deallocation/Init/Reset/Populate/Key‑setup families (state/handle management; no byte writes).
- Crypto primitives (Cipher/AE/Asymmetric; incl. Init/Update/Final) — internal transforms, not plaintext sinks.
- Debug/trace/log macros (TRACE_*, DMSG/IMSG/EMSG) — exclude to reduce noise.
- Type/descriptor/access‑check helpers (e.g., PARAM_TYPES, Check*).
- Ambiguous verbs (process/handle/update/prepare/compute/convert) lacking a clear, documented write signature.

DANGEROUS PARAMS (emit only canonical, cross‑platform‑stable roles)
- Prefer dest/buf and len/size. Never mark memcpy‑like source (idx 1) as dangerous.
- If a family typically has no explicit length (e.g., some sprintf variants), emit just dest.

# External Function: mbedtls_rsa_check_privkey
## Prompt:
You are a documentation‑informed screener for potential vulnerability sinks in OP‑TEE Trusted Applications (TAs).

TASK
Given ONLY a function name "mbedtls_rsa_check_privkey", return a binary decision:
- true  = sink candidate by semantics derived from the name AND your knowledge of GP TEE v1.3.1 / common C APIs
- false = not a sink candidate at this stage

THREAT CLASSES (consider any that apply)
1) Information leakage: writes attacker‑influenced bytes into REE‑visible or external buffers/channels.
2) Memory corruption: writes into a buffer where the write extent can be attacker‑controlled (len/size/loop bound).
3) Integrity impact: writes attacker‑influenced bytes to persistent/object/IO sinks affecting behavior on reload.

INCLUSION — DOCUMENTED WRITE FAMILIES (no project‑specific whitelists; use API family knowledge)
Return true if you can map the name to ONE of these families AND identify at least the destination/target parameter.
- A) memcpy‑like copy to destination buffer  
  Canonical roles: dest → idx 0; len/size → idx 2 when such param exists.
- B) printf/format‑like buffered output  
  Canonical roles: dest → idx 0; len/size → idx 1 when size is explicit.
- C) fill / random‑to‑buffer (memset/random‑like; writes pattern/generated bytes)  
  Canonical roles: dest → idx 0; len/size → idx 1 or 2 (use the documented position).
- D) persistent/object/IO write (handle, buf, len)  
  Canonical roles: buf → idx 1; len/size → idx 2.

NON‑EMPTY GUARD (avoid zero‑finds without over‑inclusion)
- If the name clearly belongs to A/B/C/D by documentation or widely known C/TEE conventions but ONLY the destination index is canonical for you, still return true with that single dangerous_param.  
- If you cannot confidently assign even the destination/target index, return false.

EXCLUSIONS (always return false at this stage)
- Allocation/Deallocation/Init/Reset/Populate/Key‑setup families (state/handle management; no byte writes).
- Crypto primitives (Cipher/AE/Asymmetric; incl. Init/Update/Final) — internal transforms, not plaintext sinks.
- Debug/trace/log macros (TRACE_*, DMSG/IMSG/EMSG) — exclude to reduce noise.
- Type/descriptor/access‑check helpers (e.g., PARAM_TYPES, Check*).
- Ambiguous verbs (process/handle/update/prepare/compute/convert) lacking a clear, documented write signature.

DANGEROUS PARAMS (emit only canonical, cross‑platform‑stable roles)
- Prefer dest/buf and len/size. Never mark memcpy‑like source (idx 1) as dangerous.
- If a family typically has no explicit length (e.g., some sprintf variants), emit just dest.
