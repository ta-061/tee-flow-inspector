  "display_name": "OP-TEE OS Core - shdr_verify_signature Double-Free (CVE-2023-41325)",
  "description": "OP-TEE OS (optee_os) before commit e2ec831c has a double-free in shdr_verify_signature() in core/crypto/. When loading a TA, shdr_verify_signature() allocates a temporary buffer for RSA/ECC signature verification. If the signature check fails after partial allocation, the cleanup path frees the same buffer twice. A malicious REE can exploit this by repeatedly loading a crafted TA image with an invalid signature. NOTE: This is an OS-core level vulnerability (TA loader, not a TA itself). Included for reference as a confirmed OP-TEE CVE with a double-free category.",
