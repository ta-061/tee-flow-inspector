# External Function: platform_check_permissions
## Prompt:
As a program analyst, is it possible to use a call platform_check_permissions as a sink when performing taint analysis? 
If so which parameters need to be checked for taint. Please answer yes or no without additional explanation. 
If yes, please indicate the corresponding parameters. For example, the system function can be used as a sink, and the first parameter needs to be checked as (system; 1).


## Response:
Yes. The parameters to check for taint would depend on the specific implementation of `platform_check_permissions`, but typically you would check the parameters that represent user input or sensitive data. For example, if it has parameters like `user_id` and `permission`, you would check them as (platform_check_permissions; 1) and (platform_check_permissions; 2).
