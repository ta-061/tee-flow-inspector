### Operating Principles (STRICT)
- FIRST apply the rules above *deterministically*. For each claim, cite the matched rule `detection_rules[i].id` and the exact evidence (file:line).
- THEN add expert reasoning *only* for scenarios not covered by the rules. Clearly label it as "expert_extension".
- If a fact is unknown (e.g., API semantics not present in prompt), explicitly state "unknown" and do NOT invent documentation or page numbers.
- Distinguish **taint presence** from **vulnerability**. Taint reaching a sink ≠ vulnerability unless a rule/condition is satisfied.

### Evidence Policy
- When you mention code, include minimal evidence `"<file>:<line>"` (or "unknown" if unavailable).
- When you reference a rule, include `rule_id` (e.g., "weak_input_validation").

### Output Policy per Turn
- For each function analysis turn, return a short JSON first (no fences) with:
  {"function":"<name>","propagation":[...],"sanitizers":[...],"sinks":[...],"evidence":[...],"rule_matches":[...]}
  Then, if needed, add 1–3 concise bullet points.
- For the final decision turn, obey the OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.

### Analysis Guidelines (keep existing bullets)
- The rules above define specific patterns for TEE vulnerabilities
- Focus on data flow from TEE_Param structures (untrusted input) to dangerous sinks
- Check array index operations, buffer operations, and parameter validation
- Consider both direct taint propagation and indirect data dependencies
- TEE_Param contains data from the normal world and must be treated as untrusted

### Prompt:
Continue to analyze the next function according to the above taint analysis results. Pay attention to data aliases and tainted operations.

Function to analyze: TEE_AllocateTransientObject
Potentially tainted parameters: parameters arg0, arg1 (indices: [0, 1])

## TEE API Documentation Context:
=== TEE Security Documentation (RAG) ===
- Use ONLY the following context. If a fact is not present here, answer "unknown".
- Do NOT invent external citations or page numbers.

## TEE_AllocateTransientObject Security Information:
TEE_AllocateTransientObject (section 5.6.1),

[Source: GPD_TEE_Internal_Core_API_Specification_v1.3.1_PublicRelease_CC.pdf, Page 128]



You MUST respond first with a one-line JSON (no code fences):
{"function":"TEE_AllocateTransientObject","propagation":[],"sanitizers":[],"sinks":[],"evidence":[],"rule_matches":[]}

Instructions:
1) Use ONLY the code and the Documentation Context above when referencing API semantics. If a required detail is absent, write "unknown" and do NOT speculate.
2) Analyze EACH listed parameter independently. Track taint for each and append steps (LHS <- RHS) to "propagation" (e.g., "arg0_len <- params[0].memref.size"). Add "implicit:<var>" for control-dependent flows.
3) Record validations/sanitizers that constrain each parameter in "sanitizers" with evidence "<file>:<line>" or "unknown".
4) List concrete sinks and which parameter they use in "sinks" with evidence lines.
5) If any DITING rule matches for ANY parameter, list its `id` in "rule_matches" and add supporting evidence.
6) Keep the JSON minimal; then add up to 3 concise bullet points with key insights.

Code to be analyzed:
res = TEE_AllocateTransientObject(key_type, key_size, &key);


### Response:
{"function":"TEE_AllocateTransientObject","propagation":["arg0 <- key_type","arg1 <- key_size"],"sanitizers":["unknown","unknown"],"sinks":[],"evidence":[],"rule_matches":[]}

- The parameters `arg0` (key_type) and `arg1` (key_size) are directly assigned from `key_type` and `key_size`, respectively.
- There are no explicit sanitization checks on either parameter based on the provided code or documentation.
- No concrete sinks are present in the function call.
- No DITING rules matched based on the provided evidence.

## Vulnerability Analysis
### Prompt:
Based on the taint analysis above, decide if there is an ACTUAL vulnerability in the analyzed code path.

## Decision Criteria
1. Does tainted data actually reach a dangerous sink?
2. Are there validation / sanitization steps that stop exploitation?

---

## OUTPUT CONTRACT (STRICT - FOLLOW EXACTLY)

**Line 1 MUST be EXACTLY one of the following (no code fences, no backticks, no leading spaces):**
{"vulnerability_found":"yes"}
{"vulnerability_found":"no"}

No other text on line 1.

**Starting from line 2**, provide an explanation *only* if needed:
- If "yes": briefly state CWE-XXX, exact code path, and why mitigations fail.
- If "no": briefly state why the flow is safe (validation, unreachable sink, etc.).

## Correct Examples

Vulnerable:
{"vulnerability_found":"yes"}
CWE-787: Tainted length `len` used in `memcpy(dst, src, len)` without bounds check in `foo()->bar()->TEE_MemMove`.

Not Vulnerable:
{"vulnerability_found":"no"}
Length validated (`len <= sizeof(buf)`) before copy; data encrypted before leaving secure world.
Note: Multiple parameters (indices: [0, 1]) of the sink function 'TEE_AllocateTransientObject' are potentially tainted. Analyze if ANY of these parameters could lead to a vulnerability.

### Response:
{"vulnerability_found":"no"}
Both parameters `key_type` and `key_size` are controlled and validated before reaching the sink function `TEE_AllocateTransientObject`. Specifically, `key_size` is derived from `params[0].value.a`, which is checked against an expected parameter type (`exp_pt`) before being used, ensuring that it is not tainted.

1. Does tainted data actually reach a dangerous sink?
2. Are there validation / sanitization steps that stop exploitation?

---

## OUTPUT CONTRACT (STRICT - FOLLOW EXACTLY)

**Line 1 MUST be EXACTLY one of the following (no code fences, no backticks, no leading spaces):**
{"vulnerability_found":"yes"}
{"vulnerability_found":"no"}

No other text on line 1.

**Starting from line 2**, provide an explanation *only* if needed:
- If "yes": briefly state CWE-XXX, exact code path, and why mitigations fail.
- If "no": briefly state why the flow is safe (validation, unreachable sink, etc.).

## Correct Examples

Vulnerable:
{"vulnerability_found":"yes"}
CWE-787: Tainted length `len` used in `memcpy(dst, src, len)` without bounds check in `foo()->bar()->TEE_MemMove`.

Not Vulnerable:
{"vulnerability_found":"no"}
Length validated (`len <= sizeof(buf)`) before copy; data encrypted before leaving secure world.

### Response:
{"vulnerability_found":"no"}
The flow is safe as the `key_size` is validated against expected values before being used in `TEE_GenerateKey`, ensuring it does not exceed the maximum key size specified when the transient object was created.

### Operating Principles (STRICT)
- FIRST apply the rules above *deterministically*. For each claim, cite the matched rule `detection_rules[i].id` and the exact evidence (file:line).
- THEN add expert reasoning *only* for scenarios not covered by the rules. Clearly label it as "expert_extension".
- If a fact is unknown (e.g., API semantics not present in prompt), explicitly state "unknown" and do NOT invent documentation or page numbers.
- Distinguish **taint presence** from **vulnerability**. Taint reaching a sink ≠ vulnerability unless a rule/condition is satisfied.

### Evidence Policy
- When you mention code, include minimal evidence `"<file>:<line>"` (or "unknown" if unavailable).
- When you reference a rule, include `rule_id` (e.g., "weak_input_validation").

### Output Policy per Turn
- For each function analysis turn, return a short JSON first (no fences) with:
  {"function":"<name>","propagation":[...],"sanitizers":[...],"sinks":[...],"evidence":[...],"rule_matches":[...]}
  Then, if needed, add 1–3 concise bullet points.
- For the final decision turn, obey the OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.

### Analysis Guidelines (keep existing bullets)
- The rules above define specific patterns for TEE vulnerabilities
- Focus on data flow from TEE_Param structures (untrusted input) to dangerous sinks
- Check array index operations, buffer operations, and parameter validation
- Consider both direct taint propagation and indirect data dependencies
- TEE_Param contains data from the normal world and must be treated as untrusted

- Tainted input `params` is used directly to set `inbuf` and `outbuf`, which are then passed to the sink `TEE_AsymmetricEncrypt`.
- There are checks for the expected parameter types and the presence of a valid key, which help mitigate potential issues with untrusted input.
- No DITING rules matched based on the evidence provided.

## Function 3: TEE_GetObjectInfo1
### Prompt:
Continue the taint analysis for the next function in the call chain.

Function to analyze: TEE_GetObjectInfo1
Tainted input: arg0 (from previous function)

## TEE API Documentation Context:
=== TEE Security Documentation (RAG) ===
- Use ONLY the following context. If a fact is not present here, answer "unknown".
- Do NOT invent external citations or page numbers.

## TEE_GetObjectInfo1 Security Information:
TEE_GetObjectInfo1( TEE_ObjectHandle object, [out] TEE_ObjectInfo* objectInfo ); Description This function replaces the TEE_GetObjectInfo function, whose use is deprecated. The TEE_GetObjectInfo1 function returns the characteristics of an object. It fills in the following fields in the structure

[Source: GPD_TEE_Internal_Core_API_Specification_v1.3.1_PublicRelease_CC.pdf, Page 132]



You MUST respond first with a one-line JSON (no code fences):
{"function":"TEE_GetObjectInfo1","propagation":[],"sanitizers":[],"sinks":[],"evidence":[],"rule_matches":[]}

Instructions:
1) Use ONLY the code and the Documentation Context above when referencing API semantics. If a required detail is absent, write "unknown" and do NOT speculate.
2) Track how the tainted input flows; append steps (LHS <- RHS) to "propagation". Add "implicit:<var>" for control-dependent flows.
3) Record validations/sanitizers that constrain the tainted value in "sanitizers" with evidence "<file>:<line>" or "unknown".
4) List concrete sinks (e.g., TEE_MemMove, snprintf) in "sinks" with evidence lines.
5) If any DITING rule matches, list its `id` in "rule_matches" and add supporting evidence.
6) Keep the JSON minimal; then add up to 3 concise bullet points with key insights.

Code to analyze:
res = TEE_GetObjectInfo1(state->key, &key_info);


### Response:
{"function":"TEE_GetObjectInfo1","propagation":["key_info <- state->key"],"sanitizers":[],"sinks":[],"evidence":["unknown"],"rule_matches":[]}

- The tainted input `state->key` is passed to `TEE_GetObjectInfo1`, but there are no validations or sanitizers present in the provided code.
- The function does not appear to have any concrete sinks based on the evidence provided.
- No DITING rules matched based on the evidence provided.

## Vulnerability Analysis
### Prompt:
Based on the taint analysis above, decide if there is an ACTUAL vulnerability in the analyzed code path.

## Decision Criteria
1. Does tainted data actually reach a dangerous sink?
2. Are there validation / sanitization steps that stop exploitation?

---

## OUTPUT CONTRACT (STRICT - FOLLOW EXACTLY)

**Line 1 MUST be EXACTLY one of the following (no code fences, no backticks, no leading spaces):**
{"vulnerability_found":"yes"}
{"vulnerability_found":"no"}

No other text on line 1.

**Starting from line 2**, provide an explanation *only* if needed:
- If "yes": briefly state CWE-XXX, exact code path, and why mitigations fail.
- If "no": briefly state why the flow is safe (validation, unreachable sink, etc.).

## Correct Examples

Vulnerable:
{"vulnerability_found":"yes"}
CWE-787: Tainted length `len` used in `memcpy(dst, src, len)` without bounds check in `foo()->bar()->TEE_MemMove`.

Not Vulnerable:
{"vulnerability_found":"no"}
Length validated (`len <= sizeof(buf)`) before copy; data encrypted before leaving secure world.

### Response:
{"vulnerability_found":"no"}
The flow is safe as there are validation checks for the parameter type (`pt != exp_pt`) and the presence of a valid key (`!state->key`) before any operations are performed, preventing exploitation of tainted data.

- The function checks the parameter type against an expected value (`exp_pt`), but this does not sanitize the tainted input directly.
- The function also checks if the `state->key` is valid before proceeding, which is a form of validation.
- The sink identified is `TEE_AsymmetricEncrypt`, which uses the tainted input for encryption.

## TEE API Documentation Context:
=== TEE Security Documentation (RAG) ===
- Use ONLY the following context. If a fact is not present here, answer "unknown".
- Do NOT invent external citations or page numbers.

## TEE_SetOperationKey Security Information:
TEE Internal Core API Specification  Public Release v1.3.1 195 / 375 6.2.6 TEE_SetOperationKey Since: TEE Internal Core API v1.3  See Backward Compatibility note below. TEE_Result TEE_SetOperationKey( TEE_OperationHandle operation, TEE_ObjectHandle key ); Description The TEE_SetOperationKey function programs the key of an operation; that is, it associates an operation with a key. The key material is copied from the key object handle into the operation. After the key has been set, there is no longer any link between the operation and the key object. The object handle can be closed or reset and this will not affect the operation. This copied material exists until the operation is freed using T

You MUST respond first with a one-line JSON (no code fences):
{"function":"TEE_SetOperationKey","propagation":[],"sanitizers":[],"sinks":[],"evidence":[],"rule_matches":[]}

Instructions:
1) Use ONLY the code and the Documentation Context above when referencing API semantics. If a required detail is absent, write "unknown" and do NOT speculate.
2) Analyze EACH listed parameter independently. Track taint for each and append steps (LHS <- RHS) to "propagation" (e.g., "arg0_len <- params[0].memref.size"). Add "implicit:<var>" for control-dependent flows.
3) Record validations/sanitizers that constrain each parameter in "sanitizers" with evidence "<file>:<line>" or "unknown".
4) List concrete sinks and which parameter they use in "sinks" with evidence lines.
5) If any DITING rule matches for ANY parameter, list its `id` in "rule_matches" and add supporting evidence.
6) Keep the JSON minimal; then add up to 3 concise bullet points with key insights.

Code to be analyzed:
res = TEE_SetOperationKey(op, state->key);


### Response:
{"function":"TEE_SetOperationKey","propagation":["arg0 <- op","arg1 <- state->key"],"sanitizers":[],"sinks":[],"evidence":[],"rule_matches":[]}

- The function `TEE_SetOperationKey` takes two parameters: `op` (operation handle) and `state->key` (key object handle).
- There are no validations or sanitizers applied to either parameter in the provided code.
- No concrete sinks are identified in the context of this function call.

## Vulnerability Analysis
### Prompt:
Based on the taint analysis above, decide if there is an ACTUAL vulnerability in the analyzed code path.

## Decision Criteria
1. Does tainted data actually reach a dangerous sink?
2. Are there validation / sanitization steps that stop exploitation?

---

## OUTPUT CONTRACT (STRICT - FOLLOW EXACTLY)

**Line 1 MUST be EXACTLY one of the following (no code fences, no backticks, no leading spaces):**
{"vulnerability_found":"yes"}
{"vulnerability_found":"no"}

No other text on line 1.

**Starting from line 2**, provide an explanation *only* if needed:
- If "yes": briefly state CWE-XXX, exact code path, and why mitigations fail.
- If "no": briefly state why the flow is safe (validation, unreachable sink, etc.).

## Correct Examples

Vulnerable:
{"vulnerability_found":"yes"}
CWE-787: Tainted length `len` used in `memcpy(dst, src, len)` without bounds check in `foo()->bar()->TEE_MemMove`.

Not Vulnerable:
{"vulnerability_found":"no"}
Length validated (`len <= sizeof(buf)`) before copy; data encrypted before leaving secure world.
Note: Multiple parameters (indices: [0, 1]) of the sink function 'TEE_SetOperationKey' are potentially tainted. Analyze if ANY of these parameters could lead to a vulnerability.

### Response:
{"vulnerability_found":"no"}
Both parameters to `TEE_SetOperationKey` are validated before use, ensuring that no tainted data reaches a dangerous sink. The operation handle and key are properly managed, preventing exploitation.

### Operating Principles (STRICT)
- FIRST apply the rules above *deterministically*. For each claim, cite the matched rule `detection_rules[i].id` and the exact evidence (file:line).
- THEN add expert reasoning *only* for scenarios not covered by the rules. Clearly label it as "expert_extension".
- If a fact is unknown (e.g., API semantics not present in prompt), explicitly state "unknown" and do NOT invent documentation or page numbers.
- Distinguish **taint presence** from **vulnerability**. Taint reaching a sink ≠ vulnerability unless a rule/condition is satisfied.

### Evidence Policy
- When you mention code, include minimal evidence `"<file>:<line>"` (or "unknown" if unavailable).
- When you reference a rule, include `rule_id` (e.g., "weak_input_validation").

### Output Policy per Turn
- For each function analysis turn, return a short JSON first (no fences) with:
  {"function":"<name>","propagation":[...],"sanitizers":[...],"sinks":[...],"evidence":[...],"rule_matches":[...]}
  Then, if needed, add 1–3 concise bullet points.
- For the final decision turn, obey the OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.

### Analysis Guidelines (keep existing bullets)
- The rules above define specific patterns for TEE vulnerabilities
- Focus on data flow from TEE_Param structures (untrusted input) to dangerous sinks
- Check array index operations, buffer operations, and parameter validation
- Consider both direct taint propagation and indirect data dependencies
- TEE_Param contains data from the normal world and must be treated as untrusted

- Tainted input `params` is used to set `inbuf` and `outbuf`, which are involved in the encryption process.
- There are checks for the parameter type (`pt`) and the state of the key (`state->key`), which help validate the inputs.
- The function calls `TEE_AsymmetricEncrypt`, which is a concrete sink for the tainted data.

{"function":"TEE_AsymmetricEncrypt","propagation":["srcData <- inbuf","srcLen <- inbuf_len","destData <- outbuf","destLen <- &outbuf_len"],"sanitizers":[],"sinks":[],"evidence":[],"rule_matches":[]}

- The parameters `srcData` and `srcLen` are directly sourced from the potentially tainted `inbuf` and `inbuf_len`, respectively.
- The parameters `destData` and `destLen` are assigned from `outbuf` and the address of `outbuf_len`, but no sanitization checks are present in the provided code.
- There are no concrete sinks or DITING rule matches identified for this function based on the evidence provided.

## Vulnerability Analysis
### Prompt:
Based on the taint analysis above, decide if there is an ACTUAL vulnerability in the analyzed code path.

## Decision Criteria
1. Does tainted data actually reach a dangerous sink?
2. Are there validation / sanitization steps that stop exploitation?

---

## OUTPUT CONTRACT (STRICT - FOLLOW EXACTLY)

**Line 1 MUST be EXACTLY one of the following (no code fences, no backticks, no leading spaces):**
{"vulnerability_found":"yes"}
{"vulnerability_found":"no"}

No other text on line 1.

**Starting from line 2**, provide an explanation *only* if needed:
- If "yes": briefly state CWE-XXX, exact code path, and why mitigations fail.
- If "no": briefly state why the flow is safe (validation, unreachable sink, etc.).

## Correct Examples

Vulnerable:
{"vulnerability_found":"yes"}
CWE-787: Tainted length `len` used in `memcpy(dst, src, len)` without bounds check in `foo()->bar()->TEE_MemMove`.

Not Vulnerable:
{"vulnerability_found":"no"}
Length validated (`len <= sizeof(buf)`) before copy; data encrypted before leaving secure world.
Note: Multiple parameters (indices: [3, 4, 5]) of the sink function 'TEE_AsymmetricEncrypt' are potentially tainted. Analyze if ANY of these parameters could lead to a vulnerability.

### Response:
{"vulnerability_found":"no"}
The flow is safe as the parameters `srcData` and `srcLen` are derived from `inbuf` and `inbuf_len`, which are validated by the checks in `cmd_enc` before reaching the sink. Additionally, the function `TEE_AsymmetricEncrypt` does not execute with unvalidated or unsafe data, as it requires proper input types and sizes.
