The function `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint` is called with the `params` array as an argument.\n  2. Inside the function, the `cmd_id` is checked in a switch statement. The `cmd_id` is not directly tainted but is used to determine which command to execute.\n  3. If `cmd_id` matches `TA_RANDOM_CMD_GENERATE`, the function `random_number_generate(param_types, params)` is called.\n  4. The `params` array is passed directly to the `random_number_generate` function, maintaining its taint status.\n\n- **Sinks**:\n  - The `random_number_generate` function is a potential sink for tainted data.

The function checks if `param_types` matches the expected value (`exp_param_types`). If it does not match, it returns `TEE_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`, and the taint does not propagate further.\n  3. If the parameter types are valid, the function allocates memory for `buf` using `TEE_Malloc`, which is a safe operation but does not affect the taint status.\n  4. The size of the memory allocated is derived from `params[0].memref.size`, which is tainted data. Thus, the allocation is based on tainted input.\n  5.

The function calls `TEE_GenerateRandom(buf, params[0].memref.size)`, where `buf` is a pointer to the allocated memory and `params[0].memref.size` is tainted. This function generates random data and writes it to the buffer pointed to by `buf`. This operation is potentially dangerous as it uses tainted data to determine the size of the random data generated.\n  7. The function then calls `TEE_MemMove(params[0].memref.buffer, buf, params[0].memref.size)`, which moves the generated random data from `buf` to `params[0].memref.buffer`. This operation also uses tainted data (`params[0].memref.size`), propagating the taint to `params[0].memref.buffer`.\n  8. Finally, the allocated memory `buf` is freed using `TEE_Free(buf)`, which does not affect the taint status.\n\n- **New sinks**:\n  - `TEE_GenerateRandom(buf, params[0].memref.size)`: This function is a sink because it generates random data based on the tainted size parameter.\n  - `TEE_MemMove(params[0].memref.buffer, buf, params[0].memref.size)`: This function is also a sink as it moves potentially tainted data into `params[0].memref.buffer`.\n\n### Summary of Continued Taint Flow\n- **Previous taint state**: \n  - **Source**: `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint(params)`\n  - **Flow**: \n    - `params` enters `TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint`.\n    - `params` is passed to `random_number_generate` when `cmd_id` is `TA_RANDOM_CMD_GENERATE`.\n  - **Sinks**: \n    - `random_number_generate` (potentially dangerous operations depending on its implementation).\n\n- **Flow in this function**:\n  - `params` enters `random_number_generate`.\n  - `param_types` is checked against `exp_param_types`.\n  - Memory is allocated for `buf` based on `params[0].memref.size` (tainted).\n  - `TEE_GenerateRandom(buf, params[0].memref.size)` generates random data using tainted size.\n  - `TEE_MemMove(params[0].memref.buffer, buf, params[0].memref.size)` moves data to a tainted buffer.\n  - `buf` is freed.\n\n- **New sinks**: \n  - `TEE_GenerateRandom(buf, params[0].memref.size)`\n  - `TEE_MemMove(params[0].memref.buffer, buf, params[0].memref.size)`\n\nThis analysis highlights the flow of tainted data through the `random_number_generate` function and identifies new potential sinks that could lead to unsafe behavior if not properly handled."
