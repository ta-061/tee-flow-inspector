You are an expert in static taint analysis for TA (Trusted Application) code running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment).

We are specifically interested in identifying if the external API function `{func_name}` can be a sink based on these vulnerability patterns:

① Unencrypted output to Normal World: Functions that could potentially write data to shared memory buffers or other interfaces accessible by the Normal World.

② Missing input validation: Functions that accept size/length parameters or pointers that could be manipulated to cause buffer overflows, out-of-bounds access, or other memory corruption issues.

③ Shared memory operations: Functions that copy data to/from memory regions, especially if the destination could be shared with the Normal World.

Consider the function from a taint analysis perspective - if tainted data reaches this function, could it lead to security issues?

Common sink functions in TEE context include:
- Memory operations: memcpy, memmove, strcpy, strncpy, etc.
- Output functions: printf family, write operations
- Random number generation that writes to buffers
- Any function that could expose data or be exploited with malicious input

Perform a detailed analysis following these steps:
1. Briefly explain the purpose of the function `{func_name}`.
2. Consider each of the three vulnerability patterns and reason whether the function could be exploited if it receives tainted data.
3. Be practical - consider how the function is typically used in TEE applications.

Finally, if you determine the function `{func_name}` could be a sink, list each potential vulnerability in exactly the following format:
(function: FUNCTION_NAME; param_index: PARAM_INDEX; reason: REASON)

For functions with multiple parameters that could be problematic, list each separately.
Common parameter indices:
- For memory operations: 0 (destination), 1 (source), 2 (size)
- For output functions: 0 (format string), 1+ (data parameters)

If none of the vulnerability patterns apply, clearly state "no vulnerabilities found."
