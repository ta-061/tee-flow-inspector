Continue the taint analysis for the next step in the call chain.

You will receive:
- Code to analyze: 
{code}
- (Optional) Upstream context: {upstream_context}   # e.g., previously tainted symbol (often a single item)

=== FALSE-POSITIVE GUARDRAILS (NEGATIVE RULES) ===
- Data originating from `TEE_GenerateRandom` is NON-SENSITIVE by default.
  Copying such data to `MEMREF_OUTPUT` MUST NOT be flagged as `unencrypted_output`.
- Allocators/deallocators (e.g., `TEE_Malloc`, `TEE_Free`) are NOT sinks.
- Emit a finding ONLY if BOTH are true:
  (1) attacker-controlled or sensitive taint reaches a dangerous sink, AND
  (2) no effective validation/sanitization prevents exploitation.

=== WHAT TO INFER (NO MANUAL NAMES PROVIDED) ===
- Infer the current function name from the code’s signature. If unavailable, set "function":"unknown".
- Initialize TAINTED from the upstream context if provided. Otherwise, assume no taint unless the code clearly ingests untrusted input.
- Track explicit dataflow only (assignments, parameter passing, buffer writes/reads). For control dependence, annotate as "implicit:<var>".

=== OUTPUT CONTRACT (STRICT — EXACTLY TWO LINES) ===
Line 1: a single JSON object with these fields:
{"function":"<auto-inferred or 'unknown'>","propagation":[],"sanitizers":[],"sinks":[],"evidence":[],"rule_matches":[]}

Line 2: a single line starting with FINDINGS= and containing JSON:
FINDINGS={"items":[{"rule":"unencrypted_output|weak_input_validation|shared_memory_overwrite","file":"<path>","line":123,"why":"<one sentence>","evidence":"<file>:<line>","code_excerpt":"<short>"}]}

Rules for Line 2:
- Always print the FINDINGS line; if nothing qualifies, output: FINDINGS={"items":[]}
- Allowed rule values are exactly: unencrypted_output, weak_input_validation, shared_memory_overwrite.
- Each item MUST include concrete code evidence (`<file>:<line>`). If unknown, use evidence:"unknown".
- DO NOT print any extra text before/after these two lines. No additional bullets or explanations.

=== ANALYSIS STEPS (APPLY TO THE GIVEN CODE) ===
1) Parse the function signature to infer the function name (or "unknown").
2) Initialize TAINTED from upstream context (if given). Otherwise, derive only when the code clearly ingests untrusted input.
3) Record dataflow:
   - Append "LHS <- RHS @ <file>:<line>" to "propagation" for each explicit flow/alias.
4) Identify validators/sanitizers and add them to "sanitizers" with evidence lines (bounds checks, type checks, TEE_CheckMemoryAccessRights, length caps).
5) Identify dangerous sinks and add them to "sinks" with evidence lines.
   - Exclude alloc/free; treat cross-world or shared-memory writes as sinks only when tainted data/length is used.
6) Check parameter-type consistency:
   - If `param_types` declaration conflicts with actual reads/writes (e.g., reading from NONE/OUTPUT), record in "evidence" with lines; map to `weak_input_validation` only if it enables attacker influence to reach a sink.
