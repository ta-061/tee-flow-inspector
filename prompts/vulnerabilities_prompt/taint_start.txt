As a Trusted Application program analyst, analyze the following Trusted Application C code for taint data flow.

Function to analyze: {source_function}
Tainted parameters: {param_name}

Instructions:
1. Track how the tainted parameters flow through the function
2. Identify any data aliases (e.g., pointers, struct members)
3. Note any operations that propagate taint to new variables
4. Consider both explicit data flow (assignments) and implicit flow (control dependencies)

Code to analyze:
{code}

Output a clear data flow analysis showing how tainted data propagates through the function.
