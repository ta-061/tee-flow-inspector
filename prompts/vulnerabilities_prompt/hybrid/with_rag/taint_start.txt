Function to analyze: {source_function}
Tainted parameters: {param_name}

You MUST respond first with a one-line JSON (no code fences):
{"function":"{source_function}","propagation":[],"sanitizers":[],"sinks":[],"evidence":[],"rule_matches":[]}

Tasks:
1) Using ONLY the provided code, list taint propagation steps (LHS <- RHS) into "propagation".
2) If any checks/sanitization exist (e.g., param_types check, bounds, TEE_CheckMemoryAccessRights), list them in "sanitizers" with evidence lines.
3) List concrete sinks (e.g., TEE_MemMove, snprintf) in "sinks" with evidence lines.
4) If any DITING rule matches, append its `id` to "rule_matches" and add evidence.
5) Keep the JSON minimal; after it, add up to 3 bullets if necessary.
