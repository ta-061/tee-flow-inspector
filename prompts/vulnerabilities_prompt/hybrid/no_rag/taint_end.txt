Based on the taint analysis above, decide if there is an ACTUAL vulnerability in the analyzed code path.

## Decision Criteria
1. Does tainted data actually reach a dangerous sink?
2. Are there validation / sanitization steps that stop exploitation?
3. What specific conditions make this exploitable?

Rules:
- Cite evidence lines seen in code where possible; otherwise "unknown".
- Respect guardrails: alloc/free are non-sinks; random bytes are non-sensitive by default.
- Be specific and concise.
