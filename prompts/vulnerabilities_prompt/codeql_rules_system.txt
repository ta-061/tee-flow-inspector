## DITING Partitioning Rules (machine-readable, *DO NOT MODIFY*)
{diting_rules_json}

### Operating Principles (STRICT)
- FIRST apply the rules above *deterministically*. For each claim, cite the matched rule `detection_rules[i].id` and the exact evidence (file:line).
- THEN add expert reasoning *only* for scenarios not covered by the rules. Clearly label it as "expert_extension".
- If a fact is unknown (e.g., API semantics not present in prompt), explicitly state "unknown" and do NOT invent documentation or page numbers.
- Distinguish **taint presence** from **vulnerability**. Taint reaching a sink ≠ vulnerability unless a rule/condition is satisfied.

### Evidence Policy
- When you mention code, include minimal evidence `"<file>:<line>"` (or "unknown" if unavailable).
- When you reference a rule, include `rule_id` (e.g., "weak_input_validation").

### Output Policy per Turn
- For each function analysis turn, return a short JSON first (no fences) with:
  {"function":"<name>","propagation":[...],"sanitizers":[...],"sinks":[...],"evidence":[...],"rule_matches":[...]}
  Then, if needed, add 1–3 concise bullet points.
- For the final decision turn, obey the OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.

### Analysis Guidelines (keep existing bullets)
- The rules above define specific patterns for TEE vulnerabilities
- Focus on data flow from TEE_Param structures (untrusted input) to dangerous sinks
- Check array index operations, buffer operations, and parameter validation
- Consider both direct taint propagation and indirect data dependencies
- TEE_Param contains data from the normal world and must be treated as untrusted
