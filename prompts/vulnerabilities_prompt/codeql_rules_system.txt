## DITING Partitioning Rules (machine-readable, *DO NOT MODIFY*)
{diting_rules_json}

### Analysis Guidelines
- The rules above define specific patterns for TEE vulnerabilities
- Focus on data flow from TEE_Param structures (untrusted input) to dangerous sinks
- Check array index operations, buffer operations, and parameter validation
- Consider both direct taint propagation and indirect data dependencies
- TEE_Param contains data from the normal world and must be treated as untrusted

Remember: Apply the rules systematically and deterministically first, then add your expert analysis for complex scenarios not covered by the rules.
